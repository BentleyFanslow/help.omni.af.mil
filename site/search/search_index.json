This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? \u00b6 A: Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" . If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? \u00b6 A: You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil . However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the DISA Application Vetting Environment (DAVE) . Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out! \u00b6 A: Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings. Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? \u00b6 A: Yes. The correct, approved sync settings for the Aircrew Publications Library ( 55_OG ) will overwrite your notes and highlights. However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to \" ...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there... \" If you select create an annotated copy , GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your device's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will not be updated. The concern, from a Stan/Eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion. Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV. Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update? \u00b6 A: Yes. Please keep you device's software up-to-date. Any iOS software update that appears on your device (iOS settings > General > Software Update) is approved and should be applied. Occasionally, notices appear on the AF Portal and other official websites directing users to refrain from applying updates to mobile devices.

GoodReader can automatically sync individual files and entire folders from their remote versions hosted on the BOCKSCAR server. In GoodReader, all files and folders that are a part of the sync process are tagged with a special badge: You can choose whether or not you want to keep modified local files. This option may preserve notes that you've put over a PDF file, even if the corresponding remote file was deleted or modified on the server (Use this feature with caution. Please see I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? in the Mobile FAQ). There are two different types of sync: normal sync and download-only. A normal sync is two-way. It keeps the contents of a local file or a folder identical to what you have on a server. During this process, GoodReader analyzes the contents of both local and remote folders and does the following: - Looks for modified files (for example, freshly annotated PDFs) on your device and uploads them to a server, replacing old ones there - Looks for modified files on a server and downloads them to your device, replacing old ones there - Looks for new files on a server and downloads them to your device - Looks for new local files and uploads them to a server - Looks for deleted files on a server that were previously present, and deletes them from your device. - Looks for deleted local files that were previously present, and deletes them from a server. A download-only sync is one-way, from the server to your device. It is a convenient distribution method for frequently-updated documents. This type of sync doesn't care what happens with your local files; It never puts anything on the server, never deletes anything from it, it only looks for new and modified remote files and downloads them as needed. When correctly configured, files that were deleted from the server will be deleted from your local device. The Aircrew Publications Library (APL) is a download-only sync. OGV maintains APL content on the BOCKSCAR server in a folder called 55_OG . Initial Setup \u00b6 For aircrew, this is usually done just before the device is issued to you. It only needs to be done once per each file/folder you wish to synchronize. All relevant remote files will be automatically downloaded to your device when doing the very first synchronization. Instructions for initial setup: Step 1: General App Settings \u00b6 First, set up general settings in GoodReader. Tap the Settings button on the main screen. Select the General Settings menu item. In General Settings , make the following changes: Turn off Use iCloud folder Turn off Use Downloads folder Make sure that Disable device auto-lock is on/enabled Step 2: Add the BOCKSCAR WebDAV server \u00b6 Next, add the BOCKSCAR server Tap the Connect button on the main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers , then the plus sign + to add a server. Select WebDAV Server . Configure the new WebDAV Server as follows: Readable Title: BOCKSCAR URL-address: pubs.bockscar.mil Turn on/enable Windows-style name encoding Turn off Use cookies Leave all the other fields/settings unchanged Tap Add . You should now see BOCKSCAR listed as a saved server. Step 3: Set up a Sync Folder \u00b6 Now that you have the server added, we\u2019ll need to configure GoodReader to sync with a folder on that server. Note 55 OG Aircrew should sync the 55_OG folder. If you\u2019re unsure, that\u2019s probably what you should select. You can come back anytime and sync additional folders. Note Double-check the Sync Parameter settings on step 9. Incorrect settings here are a common source of sync-related issues. Tap the Connect button on GoodReader's main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers. Select BOCKSCAR. A list of folders on the server are displayed. Tap to highlight the folder you\u2019d like to sync (We want to select the folder, not view its contents. So tap the folder name, not the > to the right of it). Tap Sync , at the bottom of the screen (Be careful not to tap Download if it is an option here. We're setting up a sync, not a one-time download.) If you get a pop-up that says Folder Already Exists select Proceed . Now we\u2019ll tell GoodReader where to sync the folder to on your device. We want the folder in your top/root directory, called My Documents , so do not select any sub-folders. Tap Download Here & Synchronize . If you see a Folder Already Exists pop-up, tap OK . Configure the Sync Parameters as follows: Turn on/enable Download only sync. Make sure Delete local files is on/enabled Turn on /enable \u2026even if they were edited . POLICY ON SYNC CONFLICTS: Action needs to be Remote files have priority . Tap Sync (or Close ) You\u2019ve set up the folder to sync from the BOCKSCAR server. GoodReader will now begin to sync that folder. You should see: Updating Synced Folders \u00b6 To make sure you have the latest publications/T.O.s/files, update your synced folder(s). During the update, any synced folders configured during initial setup will pull updates from the server. Connect to a BOCKSCAR Wi-Fi Access Point. Open GoodReader. From the main screen, tap the Sync button. A progress pop-up appears during the sync process. You should see: Press the Hide button to hide this pop-up and continue the sync in the background.

You can press the popup's schedule button to set up an automatic, periodic sync execution. If you switch to another app while GoodReader's Sync is in progress, iOS may stop the sync.

Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. Sortie Viewer Introduction The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Ful Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or 20 plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. 1. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. 1. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. 2. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. 3. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" 4. After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. 5. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' NOTE: To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. NOTE: To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. NOTE: Do not use empty fields. 6. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. 21 Displays 7. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. NOTE: The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP: In the header and footer areas, if you type in \" \" it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. 8. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server 1. Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. 2. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. 3. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. 4. Click Apply. 5. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. 6. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. 7. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client 1. Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share 2. In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. NOTE: If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP: The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. 3. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc.

Right-click on a person commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board - Personnel (WinPEX only). Background colors The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments. Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board. Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. Sortie Viewer Introduction The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Ful Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or 20 plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. 1. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. 1. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. 2. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. 3. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" 4. After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. 5. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' NOTE: To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. NOTE: To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. NOTE: Do not use empty fields. 6. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. 21 Displays 7. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. NOTE: The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP: In the header and footer areas, if you type in \" \" it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. 8. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server 1. Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. 2. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. 3. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. 4. Click Apply. 5. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. 6. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. 7. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client 1. Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share 2. In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. NOTE: If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP: The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. 3. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc.

See the PEX Install Guide for instructions. The HQ module should be instaled for use by MAJCOM HQs. It should not be installed at wing or squadron level. The HQ module is used by a HQ training office or functional manager to create a standardized set of Continuation Training tasks for subordinate units. It is also used to roll up Continuation Training and scheduling data from subordinate units. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Headquarters. This wil not be present if not instal ed at your location. Build Continuation Training tasks for units Once the Headquarters module is installed, navigate to Headquarters > Training > Setup, and build Continuation Training tasks just like a local unit would. See the Continuation Training Setup help topic for detailed instructions. Send Continuation Training tasks to units When you are done building the Continuation Training tasks and are ready to provide them to subordinate units: Check the desired Tasks Right-click in the Training Tasks grid Select Export Selected Tasks and Save. PEX will generate a .dat file, with a Date Time stamp. An example filename is HQEvents-20160609014825.dat Send this file to your subordinate units and have them follow the Configure Continuation Training help topic instructions. Now that your units have a standardized Continuation Training task list, you will be able to see how they are all doing in Continuation Training. Register units with the HQ system Your units need to register with your HQ system. Send the units your HQ ePEX URL address and have them follow the Squadrons \u2013 HQ Registration help topic instructions. If you do not know the URL address, contact Comm. Go to Headquarters > Registered Units to see the registration status of your units. When a squadron has registered, a new row will appear and the Status field will show Waiting. To approve the squadron registration, highlight the row, click in the Waiting field, and select from the dropdown - Approved. Click off the row to save. The squadron is now registered and can start pushing Continuation Training or Scheduling data to the HQ. The only editable field on this page is Status. Al other data comes from the unit level. Build Continuation Training Tasks \u00b6 Introduction This module is used to create a set of standard training tasks that can be exported into a file and sent to subordinate units. Note Once a subordinate unit imports these tasks, they cannot be edited. That is by design, to ensure standardization. Build HQ Continuation Training Unit Tasks Login as PexAdmin. Only PexAdmin can build the tasks. In ePEX (only), go to Headquarters > Continuation Tng Tasks > Setup tab. Build the tasks just like building them outside of the HQ module. Instructions are found in the Configure Continuation Training help topic. Export the tasks to a file When your tasks are built, check the boxes for the tasks you want to export (select the box in the header to select all tasks). Right-click and select Export Selected Tasks. The resulting file can be distributed to subordinate units via email or download from a website. Import TACTICS data TACTICS is software used by the Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) community to track training. TACTICS data can be imported into PEX. To do so, a HQ Continuation Training Unit Task file needs to be built to mirror the training tasks in TACTICS. Using the TACTICS export file as a reference, the PEX Unit Task ID would be element #6, e.g., \u201cC00439\u201d. The Task ID must match exactly. The PEX Unit Task (name) would be element #7, e.g., \u201c1. Mission Organization of NAF/Group/Unit\u201d. The name does not have to match exactly and could be shortened, e.g., \u201c1. Msn Org NAF/Group/Unit\u201d. For more see TACTICS - Track JTAC Training . Rollup Continuation Training Tasks \u00b6 Introduction The Headquarters > Continuation Training Rollup pages are used by a HQ training functional manager for oversight of subordinate unit Continuation Training. PEX refers to HQ as MAJCOM and subordinate units as Squadrons. The module al ows the MAJCOM Training FM to view the most current training progress for all squadrons which are registered, approved, and sending Continuation Training data to MAJCOM. Note Access to the HQ module is controlled. Contact the PEX Help Desk to get a copy of the instruction, \u201cHow to Enable the Headquarters Module\u201d. Navigation From the PEX menu, select Headquarters > Continuation Tng Roll up. The page has two tabs: Overview and Tasks.

The traditional menu commands in newer PEX modules have been replaced or supplemented by right-click \"context\" menus. PEX context menus perform a function in the grid where the mouse pointer is located when right clicked. A PEX grid is an area on the display with column headers, columns, and rows. The context menus include standard commands found in each of the new modules plus commands unique to the module in use. The standard commands are: Add - Adds a record to the current grid. Delete - Deletes the highlighted record of the current grid. Grid Settings - Allows you to hide or unhide columns, change the font size, or number of records to display per page for the current grid. Save Layout - Saves the changes you have made to the screen layout. Restore to Original - Returns the screen layout to the default layout. Export to Excel - Exports the grid to Excel (if installed). Print Grid - Prints the grid (if a printer is installed). Filter Grid - Filters the data based on a Column and user-entered text. PEX Environment \u00b6 PEX operates in an M$ Windows environment. Dark Gray Column Headings . Column headings that are a darker shade of gray than the others in a grid denote required entries before a particular line of data (record) can be saved to the database. Right-clicking . PEX makes extensive use of the right-click feature of the mouse, normally to add and delete data or to bring up menu items. Refresh Icon . With multiple windows (e.g., Mission Board, Resources Rainbow) open simultaneously, a change on one will not update the other(s) unless the other(s) are \u201drefreshed.\u201d The Refresh Icon is available on all windows for this purpose. Saving Data . To save data to the PEX database, it is not necessary to use a \u201dFile, Save\u201d type command as in MS Word or Excel. Once the required fields (indicated by dark gray column headings) in a line of data (record) are entered, all that is necessary to save the data is to click off the line of data to another line. Sorting Columns . Most columns within PEX can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column heading. Only one column can be chosen to sort at a time. The sorted column will rearrange the order of the remaining columns in the grid. You cannot add a new record once the columns have been sorted until you exit and reenter the application. ToolTip Notations . On numerous controls throughout PEX, if the cursor is rested on a control for a couple of seconds a ToolTip notation will appear with additional data associated with that control. Light Gray Shading . If a data field is shaded light-gray, that indicates the field is non-editable. Line Highlighting for Selected Items .
