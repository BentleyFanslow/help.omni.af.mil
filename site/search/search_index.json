A: Yes, You can Configure your AppleID. This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? A: Due to Security Requirements, all Applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" If the app is contained within the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? A: There is a consdierable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil.
