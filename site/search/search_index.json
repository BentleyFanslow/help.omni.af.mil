This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? \u00b6 A: Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" . If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? \u00b6 A: You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil . However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the DISA Application Vetting Environment (DAVE) . Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out! \u00b6 A: Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings. Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? \u00b6 A: Yes. The correct, approved sync settings for the Aircrew Publications Library ( 55_OG ) will overwrite your notes and highlights. However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to \" ...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there... \" I you select create an annotated copy , GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your devivce's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will not be updated. The concern, from a stan/eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion. Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV. Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update? \u00b6 A: Yes. Please keep you device's software up-to-date. Any iOS software update that appears on your device (iOS settings > General > Software Update) is approved and should be applied. Occasionally, notices appear on the AF Portal and other official websites directing users to refrain from applying updates to mobile devices.

GoodReader can automatically sync individual files and entire folders from their remote versions hosted on the BOCKSCAR server. In GoodReader, all files and folders that are a part of the sync process are tagged with a special badge: You can choose whether or not you want to keep modified local files. This option may preserve notes that you've put over a PDF file, even if the corresponding remote file was deleted or modified on the server (Use this feature with caution. Please see I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? in the Mobile FAQ. There are two different types of sync: normal sync and download-only. A normal sync is two-way. It keeps the contents of a local file or a folder identical to what you have on a server. During this process, GoodReader analyzes the contents of both local and remote folders and does the following: - Looks for modified files (for example, freshly annotated PDFs) on your device and uploads them to a server, replacing old ones there - Looks for modified files on a server and downloads them to your device, replacing old ones there - Looks for new files on a server and downloads them to your device - Looks for new local files and uploads them to a server - Looks for deleted files on a server that were previously present, and deletes them from your device. - Looks for deleted local files that were previously present, and deletes them from a server. A download-only sync is one-way, from the server to your device. It is a convenient distribution method for frequently-updated documents. This type of sync doesn't care what happens with your local files; It never puts anything on the server, never deletes anything from it, it only looks for new and modified remote files and downloads them as needed. When correctly configured, files that were deleted from the server will be deleted from your local device. The Aircrew Publications Library (APL) is a download-only sync. OGV maintains APL content on the BOCKSCAR server in a folder called 55_OG . Initial Setup \u00b6 For aircrew, this is usually done just before the device is issued to you. It only needs to be done once per each file/folder you wish to synchronize. All relevant remote files will be automatically downloaded to your device when doing the very first synchronization. Instructions for initial setup: Step 1: General App Settings \u00b6 First, set up general settings in GoodReader. Tap the Settings button on the main screen. Select the General Settings menu item. In General Settings , make the following changes: Turn off Use iCloud folder Turn off Use Downloads folder Make sure that Disable device auto-lock is on/enabled Step 2: Add the BOCKSCAR WebDAV server \u00b6 Next, add the BOCKSCAR server Tap the Connect button on the main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers , then the plus sign + to add a server. Select WebDAV Server . Configure the new WebDAV Server as follows: Readable Title: BOCKSCAR URL-address: pubs.bockscar.mil Turn on/enable Windows-style name encoding Turn off Use cookies Leave all the other fields/settings unchanged Tap Add . You should now see BOCKSCAR listed as a saved server. Step 3: Set up a Sync Folder \u00b6 Now that you have the server added, we\u2019ll need to configure GoodReader to sync with a folder on that server. Note 55 OG Aircrew should sync the 55_OG folder. If you\u2019re unsure, that\u2019s probably what you should select. You can come back anytime and sync additional folders. Note Double-check the Sync Parameter settings on step 9. Incorrect settings here are a common source of sync-related issues. Tap the Connect button on GoodReader's main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers. Select BOCKSCAR. A list of folders on the server are displayed. Tap to highlight the folder you\u2019d like to sync (We want to select the folder, not view its contents. So tap the folder name, not the > to the right of it). Tap Sync , at the bottom of the screen (Be careful not to tap Download if it is an option here. We're setting up a sync, not a one-time download.) If you get a pop-up that says Folder Already Exists select Proceed . Now we\u2019ll tell GoodReader where to sync the folder to on your device. We want the folder in your top/root directory, called My Documents , so do not select any sub-folders. Tap Download Here & Synchronize . If you see a Folder Already Exists pop-up, tap OK . Configure the Sync Parameters as follows: Turn on/enable Download only sync. Make sure Delete local files is on/enabled Turn on /enable \u2026even if they were edited . POLICY ON SYNC CONFLICTS: Action needs to be Remote files have priority . Tap Sync (or Close ) You\u2019ve set up the folder to sync from the BOCKSCAR server. GoodReader will now begin to sync that folder. You should see: Updating Synced Folders \u00b6 To make sure you have the latest publications/T.O.s/files, update your synced folder(s). During the update, any synced configured during initial setup will pull updates from the server. Connect to a BOCKSCAR Wi-Fi Access Point. Open GoodReader. From the main screen, tap the Sync button. A progress pop-up appears during the sync process. You should see: Press the Hide button to hide this pop-up and continue the sync in the background. You'll be able to continue reading your documents while the sync is working (Press the Sync button again to bring back the hidden progress popup). You can press the popup's schedule button to set up an automatic, periodic sync execution. If you switch to another app while GoodReader's Sync is in progress, iOS may stop the sync.
