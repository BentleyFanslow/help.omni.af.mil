This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? \u00b6 A: Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" . If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? \u00b6 A: You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil . However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the DISA Application Vetting Environment (DAVE) . Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out! \u00b6 A: Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings. Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? \u00b6 A: Yes. The correct, approved sync settings for the Aircrew Publications Library ( 55_OG ) will overwrite your notes and highlights. However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to \" ...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there... \" If you select create an annotated copy , GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your device's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will not be updated. The concern, from a Stan/Eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion. Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV. Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update? \u00b6 A: Yes. Please keep you device's software up-to-date. Any iOS software update that appears on your device (iOS settings > General > Software Update) is approved and should be applied. Occasionally, notices appear on the AF Portal and other official websites directing users to refrain from applying updates to mobile devices. These usually apply to devices that are operated under different AF/MDM programs and do not apply to devices managed by OMNI/Project BOCKSCAR.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Mobile/FAQ/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"Mobile/FAQ/#q-can-i-add-my-appleid-to-my-device","text":"A: Yes, You can Configure your AppleID.

GoodReader can automatically sync individual files and entire folders from their remote versions hosted on the BOCKSCAR server. In GoodReader, all files and folders that are a part of the sync process are tagged with a special badge: You can choose whether or not you want to keep modified local files. This option may preserve notes that you've put over a PDF file, even if the corresponding remote file was deleted or modified on the server (Use this feature with caution. Please see I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? in the Mobile FAQ). There are two different types of sync: normal sync and download-only. A normal sync is two-way. It keeps the contents of a local file or a folder identical to what you have on a server. During this process, GoodReader analyzes the contents of both local and remote folders and does the following: - Looks for modified files (for example, freshly annotated PDFs) on your device and uploads them to a server, replacing old ones there - Looks for modified files on a server and downloads them to your device, replacing old ones there - Looks for new files on a server and downloads them to your device - Looks for new local files and uploads them to a server - Looks for deleted files on a server that were previously present, and deletes them from your device. - Looks for deleted local files that were previously present, and deletes them from a server. A download-only sync is one-way, from the server to your device. It is a convenient distribution method for frequently-updated documents. This type of sync doesn't care what happens with your local files; It never puts anything on the server, never deletes anything from it, it only looks for new and modified remote files and downloads them as needed. When correctly configured, files that were deleted from the server will be deleted from your local device. The Aircrew Publications Library (APL) is a download-only sync. OGV maintains APL content on the BOCKSCAR server in a folder called 55_OG . Initial Setup \u00b6 For aircrew, this is usually done just before the device is issued to you. It only needs to be done once per each file/folder you wish to synchronize. All relevant remote files will be automatically downloaded to your device when doing the very first synchronization. Instructions for initial setup: Step 1: General App Settings \u00b6 First, set up general settings in GoodReader. Tap the Settings button on the main screen. Select the General Settings menu item. In General Settings , make the following changes: Turn off Use iCloud folder Turn off Use Downloads folder Make sure that Disable device auto-lock is on/enabled Step 2: Add the BOCKSCAR WebDAV server \u00b6 Next, add the BOCKSCAR server Tap the Connect button on the main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers , then the plus sign + to add a server. Select WebDAV Server . Configure the new WebDAV Server as follows: Readable Title: BOCKSCAR URL-address: pubs.bockscar.mil Turn on/enable Windows-style name encoding Turn off Use cookies Leave all the other fields/settings unchanged Tap Add . You should now see BOCKSCAR listed as a saved server. Step 3: Set up a Sync Folder \u00b6 Now that you have the server added, we\u2019ll need to configure GoodReader to sync with a folder on that server. Note 55 OG Aircrew should sync the 55_OG folder. If you\u2019re unsure, that\u2019s probably what you should select. You can come back anytime and sync additional folders. Note Double-check the Sync Parameter settings on step 9. Incorrect settings here are a common source of sync-related issues. Tap the Connect button on GoodReader's main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers. Select BOCKSCAR. A list of folders on the server are displayed. Tap to highlight the folder you\u2019d like to sync (We want to select the folder, not view its contents. So tap the folder name, not the > to the right of it). Tap Sync , at the bottom of the screen (Be careful not to tap Download if it is an option here. We're setting up a sync, not a one-time download.) If you get a pop-up that says Folder Already Exists select Proceed . Now we\u2019ll tell GoodReader where to sync the folder to on your device. We want the folder in your top/root directory, called My Documents , so do not select any sub-folders. Tap Download Here & Synchronize . If you see a Folder Already Exists pop-up, tap OK . Configure the Sync Parameters as follows: Turn on/enable Download only sync. Make sure Delete local files is on/enabled Turn on /enable \u2026even if they were edited . POLICY ON SYNC CONFLICTS: Action needs to be Remote files have priority . Tap Sync (or Close ) You\u2019ve set up the folder to sync from the BOCKSCAR server. GoodReader will now begin to sync that folder. You should see: Updating Synced Folders \u00b6 To make sure you have the latest publications/T.O.s/files, update your synced folder(s). During the update, any synced folders configured during initial setup will pull updates from the server. Connect to a BOCKSCAR Wi-Fi Access Point. Open GoodReader. From the main screen, tap the Sync button. A progress pop-up appears during the sync process. You should see: Press the Hide button to hide this pop-up and continue the sync in the background. You'll be able to continue reading your documents while the sync is working (Press the Sync button again to bring back the hidden progress popup). You can press the popup's schedule button to set up an automatic, periodic sync execution. If you switch to another app while GoodReader's Sync is in progress, iOS may stop the sync.

Resources Rainbow \u00b6 Introduction The Resources Rainbow displays Aircraft, Location, Mission, Personnel, and Squadron Commitments in a spreadsheet format. Basic User permissions are sufficient to view the Resources Rainbow. Permissions The permission roles allowed to create Resources Rainbow filters are Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, Operations Desk, Operations Staff, Training Administrator, or Administrator. Setup the Resources Rainbow On each ePEX tab, click the Display Options icon to select the data you want to see. In WinPEX, click the icons. Committed Resources - Shows only scheduled resources All Resources - Shows unscheduled resources, in addition to scheduled resources. Availability - For people who entered Personnel Availability, their availability information is viewable on the Day and Week views. Availability does not show in the Month view. Use the Resources Rainbow The Resources Rainbow is used to see the schedule in order to make decisions. When there is only one commitment in a time cell, the number 1 is not shown so that the display is not cluttered with a bunch of ones. When there is more than one commitment within a time cel , the number of commitments is shown. To display details about the commitment(s), click on the commitment cell.

Background colors The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments. Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board. Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. Sortie Viewer \u00b6 Introduction The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' Note To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. Note To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. Note Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. Note The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. Note If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc. Sortie Viewer Menu File - Same as PEX Edit - Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste are non-functional this version. Clear Data \u2013 Removes all labels and data elements from the Selected Labels and Data Elements box. Also available as an icon on the menubar. View - Toolbar. Turns the Toolbar on and off.

The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' Note To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. Note To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. Note Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. Note The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. Note If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units.

Only PexAdmin can build the tasks. In ePEX (only), go to Headquarters > Continuation Tng Tasks > Setup tab. Build the tasks just like building them outside of the HQ module. Instructions are found in the Configure Continuation Training help topic. Export the tasks to a file When your tasks are built, check the boxes for the tasks you want to export (select the box in the header to select all tasks). Right-click and select Export Selected Tasks. The resulting file can be distributed to subordinate units via email or download from a website. Import TACTICS data TACTICS is software used by the Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) community to track training. TACTICS data can be imported into PEX. To do so, a HQ Continuation Training Unit Task file needs to be built to mirror the training tasks in TACTICS. Using the TACTICS export file as a reference, the PEX Unit Task ID would be element #6, e.g., \u201cC00439\u201d. The Task ID must match exactly. The PEX Unit Task (name) would be element #7, e.g., \u201c1. Mission Organization of NAF/Group/Unit\u201d. The name does not have to match exactly and could be shortened, e.g., \u201c1.

About PEX Brings up dialog listing software version. New PEX Modules \u00b6 All PEX modules will be rewritten in more advanced computer languages as they become available. The traditional menu commands in newer PEX modules have been replaced or supplemented by right-click \"context\" menus. PEX context menus perform a function in the grid where the mouse pointer is located when right clicked. A PEX grid is an area on the display with column headers, columns, and rows. The context menus include standard commands found in each of the new modules plus commands unique to the module in use. The standard commands are: Add - Adds a record to the current grid. Delete - Deletes the highlighted record of the current grid. Grid Settings - Allows you to hide or unhide columns, change the font size, or number of records to display per page for the current grid. Save Layout - Saves the changes you have made to the screen layout. Restore to Original - Returns the screen layout to the default layout. Export to Excel - Exports the grid to Excel (if installed). Print Grid - Prints the grid (if a printer is installed). Filter Grid - Filters the data based on a Column and user-entered text. PEX Environment \u00b6 PEX operates in an M$ Windows environment. Dark Gray Column Headings . Column headings that are a darker shade of gray than the others in a grid denote required entries before a particular line of data (record) can be saved to the database. Right-clicking . PEX makes extensive use of the right-click feature of the mouse, normally to add and delete data or to bring up menu items. Refresh Icon . With multiple windows (e.g., Mission Board, Resources Rainbow) open simultaneously, a change on one will not update the other(s) unless the other(s) are \u201drefreshed.\u201d The Refresh Icon is available on all windows for this purpose. Saving Data . To save data to the PEX database, it is not necessary to use a \u201dFile, Save\u201d type command as in MS Word or Excel. Once the required fields (indicated by dark gray column headings) in a line of data (record) are entered, all that is necessary to save the data is to click off the line of data to another line. Sorting Columns . Most columns within PEX can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column heading. Only one column can be chosen to sort at a time. The sorted column will rearrange the order of the remaining columns in the grid. You cannot add a new record once the columns have been sorted until you exit and reenter the application. ToolTip Notations . On numerous controls throughout PEX, if the cursor is rested on a control for a couple of seconds a ToolTip notation will appear with additional data associated with that control. Light Gray Shading . If a data field is shaded light-gray, that indicates the field is non-editable. Line Highlighting for Selected Items .

The Binders module is divided into two sections, Binders and Setup. The Setup page al ows you to create different Binder Types and Documentation Folders to setup your binders. The Binders page allows you to create binders; associate owners and alternate owners to the binder; import and export binders and add observations and documents to a binder. PEX al ows you to create different binder types such as Self-Assessment, Continuity, etc. This enables you to establish a standardized documentation folders structure for each binder type. A Self-Assessment binder type with its associated documentation folders is delivered with PEX software. Permissions Two (2) permission roles and four (4) pseudo-roles can access Binders, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator: Binder Administrator can perform every function in the module and can access and manage every binder for each squadron in which they are assigned the role. Binder Read Only is able to access and view every binder in the squadron(s) to which they are assigned the role, but they cannot perform any of the functions. The following are pseudo-roles, assigned from within the binder. The purpose of these pseudo-roles is to allow personnel with no other Binder roles to be able to access and work in the specific binder(s) in which they are assigned the pseudo-role: Binder Owner \u2013 Able to manage documentation and observations. Unlike Binder Administrator, the only binder function at the top of the Binders page which they can execute is documenting and viewing Binder Reviews. Alternate \u2013 Able to manage documentation and observations. Also able to document and view Binder Reviews. Self-Assessment Program Manager (SAPM). Able to manage documentation and observations. Also able to document and view Binder Reviews. Binder Read Only Alternate. Able to view all documentation and observations. Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Binder Owners are set in the Binder Details. Alternates, SAPMs, and Binder Read Only Alternates are assigned via Binders > Manage Alternates. Rules * Binder Types cannot be deleted if a squadron in the database is using the binder type. Module Notes * Binders interfaces with the Personnel module for the purposes of assigning Owners and Alternates. * Binders interfaces with the Squadron module for the purpose of selecting a Squadron to which a binder belongs. Workspace These features are accessed from the PEX Main Menu by navigating to Ops > Binders. Setup - Manage Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders structure of each Binder Type. Binders - Access, work in, and manage binders. This is the default page when opening the module. Notes Binders Setup uses the \u201cvisibility\u201d model for Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders in each Binder Type. This means that the Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders are visible to, and available to be used by, any squadron in the database. It also means that they can be modified by any Binder Administrator or Administrator in the database, as well as PEX Admin. Squadrons can modify the Documentation Folders structure within their own binders after creating them. Setup- Configure Binders \u00b6 Setup tab In Setup you can add and delete Binder Types as wel as the default Documentation Folders structure in each Binder Type. Binder Types To add, edit or delete Binder Types, either select the appropriate button at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select the option in the pop-up menu. Notes Binder Types cannot be deleted if a squadron in the database is using the binder type. Due to the visibility model used in Binders Setup, the names and descriptions of Binder Types should clearly indicate what units/communities are to use the binder type and for what purpose(s). This is especially important for units in MAJCOM databases. This practice will minimize different units using the same binder type for different purposes and eventual y having conflicting standards in the structure. Documentation Folders Documentation folders are tabs or sections within a binder. Here in Setup, you set the default folder structure for each binder type; thus, each binder created using a binder type is automatical y populated with the default folder structure for that binder type. Users have the capability to also retroactively insert the new folders to existing binders already using the Binder Type. This feature was added to make it easier to maintain a common folder structure for specific Binder Types. Add a Documentation Folder to a Binder Type Select the appropriate Binder Type in the drop-down at the top. Either select Add at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select Add in the popup menu. Enter the Name and optionally the Description for the folder. Click Save or Save & New to continue adding more folders. Save If there are currently any binders in the database which use the selected Binder Type and you have Administrator or Binder Administrator to the squadrons using those binders, the Add New Folders to Binders dialog will open. Click in the check box for any existing binders to which you need to add the new folder.

Although the default title is FCIF, the page is used to track all read file items, not just ones for flight crew. The FCIF page is intended to be used by multiple people in common areas. For this reason each user must enter their PEX SID to review and sign off a read file. For instructions on read file administration, see FCIF Admin. Permissions Any user can access the page. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Ops > FCIF. If the module title has been changed in FCIF Admin, it will appear as that title, for example; IRF, PRF, etc. Workspace Type - Select FCIF by Type; FCIF/IRF, Read File, etc. Filter By The standard filter available in multiple modules throughout PEX or... Squadron, MDS and Crew Position. Refresh Countdown. The page refreshes every five minutes. FCIF Admin - The link at page bottom takes you to the FCIF Admin page in the Stan Eval module.

Go NoGo \u00b6 Go/No-Go Basics \u00b6 Introduction The mobile-friendly Go/No-Go board replaces the legacy Go/No-Go display. The PEX Go/No-Go module implements a positive control system. The module allows units to customize and display a Go/No-Go board with personnel status, personnel who are current and qualified to perform their missions and personnel who are not current and qualified. The module tracks medical status (DNIF - Duty Not Including Flying), read file signoffs (FCIF - Flight Crew Information File), training tasks (TNG), exams (TEST), Stan Eval (S/E) evaluations, Mission Ready Status, \"Z\" events (FLY) and flying hour maximums (HRS). In addition, units can add customized statuses to suit local needs. Indicators Basic The person has no issues or restrictions. The person has issues that may affect their ability to fly or perform required duties. The person has issues that prevent the person from flying or performing required duties. Status is not yet calculated for the person's qualification. NA - Item not used by squadron. See the Legend for specifics on each item. Effective Msn Rdy Status Assigned BMC or CMR, and Assigned and Effective Msn Rdy Status are the same. Assigned BMC or CMR, and Probation for Effective Msn Rdy Status Assigned BMC or CMR, but performance is NBMC or NCMR. Assigned BMC, but performing at CMR. Assigned CMR, effective is calculated at NCMR, but performing at BMC. Permissions Basic User can view the Go/No-Go screen. Stan Eval Admin and Admin can set up Go/No-Go functionality. The following can override Go/No-Go module statuses. Permission Role DNIF TNG TEST Custom Setup Tab Administrator Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Supervisor of Flying No Yes No No No Operations Desk Yes Yes No Yes No Training Auditor/ARMS Yes No No Yes No Stan Eval Administrator No No Yes Yes Yes Module Notes The default column headers of DNIF and FCIF can be changed in their respective modules. Personnel with multiple MDSs and/or Crew Positions may (depending on the filters used) appear more than once on the Board. For example, a person with MDS qualifications of both B-2A and T-38A may be current on all B-2A training tasks but overdue on a T-38A tasks. That person would be green on the B-2A row and yel ow on the T-38A row. Controls Access these features from the PEX Main Menu by navigating to Ops > Go/No-Go. Workspace LUKE LEFT OFF HERE \u00b6 1.

Letter of X Letter of X Basics Introduction The Letter of X (LoX), also known as the Letter of Certifications, tracks certifications by person. Personnel can by organized into groupings by MDS, CP, etc. Certifications can be organized in unit-defined groups. LoX is database-wide using the visibility concept which allows certifications to be used by all units in the database, provided the certification is marked as visible to those units in the setup. The visibility concept makes it much easier to remove Certifications, Statuses, and Categories when not in use. Permissions \u25a0 PEX Administrator and LoX Administrator: add, manage, assign, unassign certifications and create templates and custom views. 46 \u25a0 Draft Approver: if draft approver process is enabled, approve and disapprove certification changes. \u25a0 Basic User: View LoX using already created filters, custom views and templates. Module Notes Certifications are tied to specific MDS(s) and Crew Position(s). WARNING:* Changing a LoX item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has the certification \u201cSyrian AOR Threat\u201d and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to \u201cSyrian Air Threat\u201d it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. For more see Miscellaneous > Visibility Model. * Definitions Qualification . A qualification is the person\u2019s reason for being in the squadron. It consists of an MDS and Crew Position. A person must have at least one primary qualification, but can have as many secondary qualifications as needed. A person\u2019s qualification (or Qual) is established in Setup > Personnel > Quals Tab. Certification . A Certification is a basic capability that you want to assign to a select person or group of people for scheduling and/or tracking purposes. Draft . A change to a person\u2019s certification. This only applies when the Squadron has chosen to \u201cEnable Draft Process\u201d. A change can be the first time a person is assigned the certification, a change to the person\u2019s status, certification, decertification, recertification, and/or expiration dates, and any remarks associated to the certification. Category . Categories are optional. They are used to organize certifications. Statuses . The range of symbols you want to select from when assigning someone a certification (i.e., X, I, T). The status also includes a definition. The status and definition together makes the status unique, therefore, there can be a status of T \u2013 Training and T \u2013 In Training. Assigned Mission Ready Status . What the person is assigned in the Personnel module Effective Mission Ready Status . Status the person is currently performing at based on the requirements entered in the Continuation Training module Is Certified . Each status has an \"Is Certified\" option. When checked, anyone with this status wil be counted for the respective certification in the Long Range Schedule and will be eligible for display in the Mission Board, Schedule Supervisors dropdown. For example, a status of T (for in training) would have Is Certified unchecked so trainees do not count towards shift requirements, nor would the person appear in the supervisor schedule dropdown. Visibility . An indication of whether a certification can be seen/used by a given unit LoX Template . The template determines what certifications will be displayed and in what order. It will determine if selected dates will be displayed with the certifications. It contains signature block data and remarks. Certification Date . Optional field to indicate when an individual was certified. Recertification Date . Optional field to indicate when an individual is due for recertification (notionally). 47 !(images/000066.jpg) Ops Expiration Date . Optional field that, when used (and is a date that is in the past) will cause the person to be Decertified (for expiration) in that certification. Decertification Date . Optional field that can be populated to indicate when a person was Decertified (for cause) in a given certification.

These personnel need to be assigned at least one qualification via the Personnel Module, Quals Tab. The key elements in a qualification are the MDS and Crew Position. Setup Categories 1. Go to Setup > Categories. 2. Click Add Category. 3. Enter the name, up to 25 characters, and save. Repeat as needed. For example, if you want to group your certifications under the headings Mission Qualifications and Non-Mission Qualifications, then create those two categories. Status 4. Go to Setup > Status. 5. Click Add Status. 49 Ops 6. Enter the name, up to 5 characters. Enter a Description, up to 30 Characters. Uncheck the Is Certified Box only if you don\u2019t want people assigned this status to count against mission requirements. Save. 7. Repeat for the range of statuses you plan to use. Common use cases would by X (Qualified), I (Instructor), T (Training). CAUTION: Consult someone with database-wide LoX Admin permissions (or higher) before deleting a status from the list of statuses (LoX > Setup > Statuses). Anyone in the database using that status will lose it, even if they are in a different unit to which you do not have permissions. Certifications 8. Go to Setup > Certifications 9. Click Add Certification. 10. Check at least one MDS and Crew Position. 11. Check at least one status. 12. Check the optional category (or categories) you want to associate this certification with. 13. Check the units that will use this certification (this is known as establishing visibility) 14. Click Save NOTE : You will be unable to uncheck an MDS or CP setting once the certification is saved. You will still be able to check additional MDS and Crew Position combinations for that certification, but never uncheck. If an expected MDS or CP is not listed, make sure someone is assigned to that MDS and CP in Setup > Personnel Module > Quals Tab. TTP: Sometimes units carry certifications which are progressive and exclusive. These can be combined into a single certification with a unique status. For instance, 2-ship flight lead and 4-ship flight lead do not need to be tracked as separate certifications. The Certification could be Flight Lead and the status assigned could be 2F, 4F, and T. Visibility Make certifications visible to, or remove visibility from, squadrons: 15. Check or uncheck the box in the row of the certification and column of the squadron to add or remove visibility. 16. Click the save icon. NOTE : You will not be able to add, edit, or delete a certification after you start modifying visibility until you click the save or undo icon. Associate Training Tasks to Certification Associating certifications to training tasks will display the training task status (yellow or pink) from the continuation training module on the LoX display/report. Current training will not show any color coding on the LoX display/report. 50 NOTE : When a person assigned a certification that has been associated to a training tasks, if the person is not assigned the assigned the associated training task or goes overdue for completion, then the certification status will be \u201cDT\u201d or Decertified for Training. 17.

ORM Setup ORM Introduction The ORM (Operational Risk Management) module provides a tool for assessing the risk associated with conducting missions under different conditions. The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions. Permissions \u25a0 To access and configure ORM > Setup tab: Administrator. \u25a0 To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler. \u25a0 To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles. Rules \u25a0 If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved. \u25a0 If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition. Module Notes \u25a0 The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Crew tab. \u25a0 Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued. \u25a0 The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions. Controls These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops > ORM. 59 Ops Setup Overview First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings. Setup other PEX modules for ORM Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to: 1. Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types. 2. Setup > Personnel A. In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9. B. In the Setup tab > Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 and Copilot = 25. Setup the ORM module Go to Ops > ORM > Setup tab. 3. Risk Categories. Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings. A. Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List. B. Add it if it is not contained in the Master List. 4. Risk Conditions. The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories. A. Right-click and add a row. B. Select the required Category. C. Enter a Risk Condition. D. Enter a Risk Value. E. Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. For example; Icing. Risk Category Risk Condition Risk Value Icing Light 3 Icing Moderate 5 Icing Severe 7 60 5. Risk Levels. This grid sets Approval Authority Level for accumulated risk values on each sortie. A. Right-click and add a row. B. Enter a Max Risk Level value. C. Enter a Description. D. Enter a Color. E. Enter the Approval Authority. For example; Max Risk Level Description Color Approval Authority 4 Normal Ops Aircraft Commander 7 Caution Squadron Operations Officer 10 Warning Operations Group Commander 6. Risk Weighting Settings. A. Risk Weightings. Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option. For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels. Weighted example 2 sets the values at 10, 30, 40, and 20 percent. Sortie Personnel Risk Crew Total Raw Type Experience Risk Conditions Stress Risk 5 6 4 4 19 Sortie Personnel Risk Crew Total Weighted Type Experience Risk Conditions Stress Risk (example 1) (25%) (25%) (25%) (25%) (100%) 1.25 1.5 1.0 1.0 4.75 Sortie Personnel Risk Crew Total Weighted Type Experience Risk Conditions Stress Risk (example 2) (10%) (30%) (40%) (20%) (100%) 0.5 1.8 1.6 0.8 4.7 B. Risk Graph Display. This radio button selection sets the Sortie Risk display in the ORM tab to display either Raw or Weighted. C. Save. 61 !(images/000011.jpg) Ops 7. Labels. Change column headings to fit your unit's terminology. For example, change \"Crew Stress\" to \"Pilot Stress\".

Weapons Loads and SCLs 69 Ops The Weapons module is used to define Loads, MDS Stations, and SCLs (Standard Configuration Loads) for use in the flight scheduling module. The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo. Visibility . Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron\u2019s drop-down lists. Load Item Types . Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit. Build a Load Item Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon. For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component. Preparatory Steps (This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item): 1. Go to Munitions** >** Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 3. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: 1. Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click Add. 2. The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code (e.g., A or 46), Name (e.g., AIM-9X), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required. 3. Select from available components (left grid), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid (right grid). When the desired component(s) is moved, select Save. Edit a Load Item . Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit. To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch. Delete a Load Item . Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from al squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Identify MDS Stations 1. Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > MDS Stations 3. Select the desired MDS 70 4. Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select Add 5. Name the Station. E.g., 1 or FWD Bomb Bay 6. In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. 7. To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station. Build an SCL SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 (Quantity) B-61 (Load Item) in the Forward Bomb Bay (Station) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A. Quick and Easy Way \u2013 Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don\u2019t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. Normal Way \u2013 Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on. Preparatory Steps (These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier): 1. Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 3. Go to Munitions > Setup > SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: 1. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. 2. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV AIM-9X 500 Rounds. 3. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. 4. Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station. 5. To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. 71 Ops Edit an SCL . Right-click on the SCL and select Edit. To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click Save. Delete an SCL . Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type . If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup > Validation > Mission Board > Sortie Type and pick a default SCL for your Sortie Types. Use Automatic Load Codes (formerly known as Auto SCL) Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code (formerly Auto SCL). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way: 1. Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine. 2. Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. 3. PEX will generate a Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board, once a Tail Number is selected.

AFTO Form 781 Introduction Use PEX to log AFTO 781 Mission Data and Aircrew Data. That data can then be audited within PEX and exported to the ARMS database. Setup 1. In Training > Continuation > ARMs > Settings > ARMS Data > 781 Data: enter your unit\u2019s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781. 74 2. In Maintenance > Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number. 3. Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail #, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC (Mission Symbol) and Flight Authorization # 4. Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list. Implement In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an \u201cAFTO 781\u201d link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. (They can also fill out their TAR.) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save. There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX: \u25a0 Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs. \u25a0 When a crewmember logs into PEX, on My Page, for every sortie, there is a 781 link, near the TAR link, which brings up the electronic 781. Fil out the PEX AFTO 781 1. Click on your sortie\u2019s 781 link to launch the PEX AFTO 781 dialog. 2. If you flew on more than one sortie, in the same tail number, on the same day, PEX provides you the option to include those sorties on a single AFTO 781. NOTE : ARMS uses only the Mission Number of the first flight in the sequence. 3. Fill out the Mission and Aircrew Data. Anyone can fill out the 781. NOTE : You can use one of three different mission numbers. To pick, click Select next to Mission Number at the top of the 781 dialog. Choose either (PEX) Mission Number, AMC Mission Number, or Maintenance Line Number. This is a squadron-wide setting and will be retained for future 781s until changed again. NOTE : If the tail number (or MDS) changed at the last minute, you can click on the ARMS MDS or ARMS Serial # Edit links at the top of the dialog and update. 4. The Aircraft Commander signs off the Pilot Review using their PEX PIN (mandatory). This readies the 781 for SARM audit and export to ARMS. 5. The Maintenance Debriefer types in their initials and signs off their review (optional but recommended). Print out the 781 and leave the hard copy with Maintenance.","title":"Ops"},{"location":"PEX/Ops/#ops","text":"","title":"Ops"},{"location":"PEX/Ops/#binders","text":"Introduction The Binders module allows you to create and maintain electronic binders for purposes such as program continuity, self-assessment, mobility, etc. It is accessed through the PEX main menu via Ops>Binders. The Binders module is divided into two sections, Binders and Setup. The Setup page al ows you to create different Binder Types and Documentation Folders to setup your binders. The Binders page allows you to create binders; associate owners and alternate owners to the binder; import and export binders and add observations and documents to a binder. PEX al ows you to create different binder types such as Self-Assessment, Continuity, etc. This enables you to establish a standardized documentation folders structure for each binder type. A Self-Assessment binder type with its associated documentation folders is delivered with PEX software. Permissions Two (2) permission roles and four (4) pseudo-roles can access Binders, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator: Binder Administrator can perform every function in the module and can access and manage every binder for each squadron in which they are assigned the role. Binder Read Only is able to access and view every binder in the squadron(s) to which they are assigned the role, but they cannot perform any of the functions. The following are pseudo-roles, assigned from within the binder. The purpose of these pseudo-roles is to allow personnel with no other Binder roles to be able to access and work in the specific binder(s) in which they are assigned the pseudo-role: Binder Owner \u2013 Able to manage documentation and observations. Unlike Binder Administrator, the only binder function at the top of the Binders page which they can execute is documenting and viewing Binder Reviews.

This means that the Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders are visible to, and available to be used by, any squadron in the database. It also means that they can be modified by any Binder Administrator or Administrator in the database, as well as PEX Admin. Squadrons can modify the Documentation Folders structure within their own binders after creating them.","title":"Binders"},{"location":"PEX/Ops/#setup-configure-binders","text":"Setup tab In Setup you can add and delete Binder Types as wel as the default Documentation Folders structure in each Binder Type. Binder Types To add, edit or delete Binder Types, either select the appropriate button at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select the option in the pop-up menu. Notes Binder Types cannot be deleted if a squadron in the database is using the binder type. Due to the visibility model used in Binders Setup, the names and descriptions of Binder Types should clearly indicate what units/communities are to use the binder type and for what purpose(s). This is especially important for units in MAJCOM databases. This practice will minimize different units using the same binder type for different purposes and eventual y having conflicting standards in the structure. Documentation Folders Documentation folders are tabs or sections within a binder. Here in Setup, you set the default folder structure for each binder type; thus, each binder created using a binder type is automatical y populated with the default folder structure for that binder type. Users have the capability to also retroactively insert the new folders to existing binders already using the Binder Type. This feature was added to make it easier to maintain a common folder structure for specific Binder Types. Add a Documentation Folder to a Binder Type Select the appropriate Binder Type in the drop-down at the top. Either select Add at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select Add in the popup menu. Enter the Name and optionally the Description for the folder. Click Save or Save & New to continue adding more folders.

Click in the check box for any existing binders to which you need to add the new folder. Note Users wil only be able to see, and add the new folder to, binders in squadrons to which they have Administrator or Binder Administrator role. Other squadrons may be using the binder type, but their existing binders will not be affected. However, all binders created in the future using that binder type wil include the added documentation folder. Edit a Documentation Folder in a Binder Type Select the appropriate Binder Type in the drop-down at the top. Either select View/Edit at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select View/Edit in the pop-up menu. Click in the field to be edited. Make your edits. Save. Note Edits to documentation folders are not optionally able to be made retroactively to existing binders. Such edits, if necessary, must be made from within existing binders. Delete a Documentation Folder in a Binder Type Select the appropriate Binder Type in the drop-down at the top. Click on the folder to be deleted. The row will highlight. Either select Delete at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select Delete in the pop-up menu.

Letter of X Letter of X Basics Introduction The Letter of X (LoX), also known as the Letter of Certifications, tracks certifications by person. Personnel can by organized into groupings by MDS, CP, etc. Certifications can be organized in unit-defined groups. LoX is database-wide using the visibility concept which allows certifications to be used by all units in the database, provided the certification is marked as visible to those units in the setup. The visibility concept makes it much easier to remove Certifications, Statuses, and Categories when not in use. Permissions \u25a0 PEX Administrator and LoX Administrator: add, manage, assign, unassign certifications and create templates and custom views. 46 \u25a0 Draft Approver: if draft approver process is enabled, approve and disapprove certification changes. \u25a0 Basic User: View LoX using already created filters, custom views and templates. Module Notes Certifications are tied to specific MDS(s) and Crew Position(s). WARNING:* Changing a LoX item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has the certification \u201cSyrian AOR Threat\u201d and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to \u201cSyrian Air Threat\u201d it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. For more see Miscellaneous > Visibility Model. * Definitions Qualification . A qualification is the person\u2019s reason for being in the squadron. It consists of an MDS and Crew Position. A person must have at least one primary qualification, but can have as many secondary qualifications as needed. A person\u2019s qualification (or Qual) is established in Setup > Personnel > Quals Tab. Certification . A Certification is a basic capability that you want to assign to a select person or group of people for scheduling and/or tracking purposes. Draft . A change to a person\u2019s certification. This only applies when the Squadron has chosen to \u201cEnable Draft Process\u201d. A change can be the first time a person is assigned the certification, a change to the person\u2019s status, certification, decertification, recertification, and/or expiration dates, and any remarks associated to the certification. Category . Categories are optional. They are used to organize certifications. Statuses . The range of symbols you want to select from when assigning someone a certification (i.e., X, I, T). The status also includes a definition. The status and definition together makes the status unique, therefore, there can be a status of T \u2013 Training and T \u2013 In Training. Assigned Mission Ready Status . What the person is assigned in the Personnel module Effective Mission Ready Status . Status the person is currently performing at based on the requirements entered in the Continuation Training module Is Certified . Each status has an \"Is Certified\" option. When checked, anyone with this status wil be counted for the respective certification in the Long Range Schedule and will be eligible for display in the Mission Board, Schedule Supervisors dropdown. For example, a status of T (for in training) would have Is Certified unchecked so trainees do not count towards shift requirements, nor would the person appear in the supervisor schedule dropdown. Visibility . An indication of whether a certification can be seen/used by a given unit LoX Template . The template determines what certifications will be displayed and in what order. It will determine if selected dates will be displayed with the certifications. It contains signature block data and remarks. Certification Date . Optional field to indicate when an individual was certified. Recertification Date . Optional field to indicate when an individual is due for recertification (notionally). 47 !(images/000066.jpg) Ops Expiration Date . Optional field that, when used (and is a date that is in the past) will cause the person to be Decertified (for expiration) in that certification. Decertification Date . Optional field that can be populated to indicate when a person was Decertified (for cause) in a given certification.

These personnel need to be assigned at least one qualification via the Personnel Module, Quals Tab. The key elements in a qualification are the MDS and Crew Position. Setup Categories 1. Go to Setup > Categories. 2. Click Add Category. 3. Enter the name, up to 25 characters, and save. Repeat as needed. For example, if you want to group your certifications under the headings Mission Qualifications and Non-Mission Qualifications, then create those two categories. Status 4. Go to Setup > Status. 5. Click Add Status. 49 Ops 6. Enter the name, up to 5 characters. Enter a Description, up to 30 Characters. Uncheck the Is Certified Box only if you don\u2019t want people assigned this status to count against mission requirements. Save. 7. Repeat for the range of statuses you plan to use. Common use cases would by X (Qualified), I (Instructor), T (Training). CAUTION: Consult someone with database-wide LoX Admin permissions (or higher) before deleting a status from the list of statuses (LoX > Setup > Statuses). Anyone in the database using that status will lose it, even if they are in a different unit to which you do not have permissions. Certifications 8. Go to Setup > Certifications 9. Click Add Certification. 10. Check at least one MDS and Crew Position. 11. Check at least one status. 12. Check the optional category (or categories) you want to associate this certification with. 13. Check the units that will use this certification (this is known as establishing visibility) 14. Click Save NOTE : You will be unable to uncheck an MDS or CP setting once the certification is saved. You will still be able to check additional MDS and Crew Position combinations for that certification, but never uncheck. If an expected MDS or CP is not listed, make sure someone is assigned to that MDS and CP in Setup > Personnel Module > Quals Tab. TTP: Sometimes units carry certifications which are progressive and exclusive. These can be combined into a single certification with a unique status. For instance, 2-ship flight lead and 4-ship flight lead do not need to be tracked as separate certifications. The Certification could be Flight Lead and the status assigned could be 2F, 4F, and T. Visibility Make certifications visible to, or remove visibility from, squadrons: 15. Check or uncheck the box in the row of the certification and column of the squadron to add or remove visibility. 16. Click the save icon. NOTE : You will not be able to add, edit, or delete a certification after you start modifying visibility until you click the save or undo icon. Associate Training Tasks to Certification Associating certifications to training tasks will display the training task status (yellow or pink) from the continuation training module on the LoX display/report. Current training will not show any color coding on the LoX display/report. 50 NOTE : When a person assigned a certification that has been associated to a training tasks, if the person is not assigned the assigned the associated training task or goes overdue for completion, then the certification status will be \u201cDT\u201d or Decertified for Training. 17.

ORM Setup ORM Introduction The ORM (Operational Risk Management) module provides a tool for assessing the risk associated with conducting missions under different conditions. The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions. Permissions \u25a0 To access and configure ORM > Setup tab: Administrator. \u25a0 To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler. \u25a0 To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles. Rules \u25a0 If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved. \u25a0 If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition. Module Notes \u25a0 The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Crew tab. \u25a0 Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued. \u25a0 The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions. Controls These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops > ORM. 59 Ops Setup Overview First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings. Setup other PEX modules for ORM Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to: 1. Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types. 2. Setup > Personnel A. In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9. B. In the Setup tab > Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 and Copilot = 25. Setup the ORM module Go to Ops > ORM > Setup tab. 3. Risk Categories. Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings. A. Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List. B. Add it if it is not contained in the Master List. 4. Risk Conditions. The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories. A. Right-click and add a row. B. Select the required Category. C. Enter a Risk Condition. D. Enter a Risk Value. E. Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. For example; Icing. Risk Category Risk Condition Risk Value Icing Light 3 Icing Moderate 5 Icing Severe 7 60 5. Risk Levels. This grid sets Approval Authority Level for accumulated risk values on each sortie. A. Right-click and add a row. B. Enter a Max Risk Level value. C. Enter a Description. D. Enter a Color. E. Enter the Approval Authority. For example; Max Risk Level Description Color Approval Authority 4 Normal Ops Aircraft Commander 7 Caution Squadron Operations Officer 10 Warning Operations Group Commander 6. Risk Weighting Settings. A. Risk Weightings. Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option. For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels. Weighted example 2 sets the values at 10, 30, 40, and 20 percent.

Weapons Loads and SCLs 69 Ops The Weapons module is used to define Loads, MDS Stations, and SCLs (Standard Configuration Loads) for use in the flight scheduling module. The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo. Visibility . Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron\u2019s drop-down lists. Load Item Types . Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit. Build a Load Item Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon. For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component. Preparatory Steps (This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item): 1. Go to Munitions** >** Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 3. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: 1. Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click Add. 2. The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code (e.g., A or 46), Name (e.g., AIM-9X), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required. 3. Select from available components (left grid), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid (right grid). When the desired component(s) is moved, select Save. Edit a Load Item . Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit. To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch. Delete a Load Item . Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from al squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Identify MDS Stations 1. Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > MDS Stations 3. Select the desired MDS 70 4. Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select Add 5. Name the Station. E.g., 1 or FWD Bomb Bay 6. In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. 7. To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station. Build an SCL SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 (Quantity) B-61 (Load Item) in the Forward Bomb Bay (Station) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A. Quick and Easy Way \u2013 Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don\u2019t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. Normal Way \u2013 Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on. Preparatory Steps (These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier): 1. Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 2. Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 3. Go to Munitions > Setup > SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. Building Steps: 1. Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. 2. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV AIM-9X 500 Rounds. 3. In the Used By grid, select the MDS(s) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. 4. Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station. 5. To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. 71 Ops Edit an SCL . Right-click on the SCL and select Edit. To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click Save. Delete an SCL . Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don\u2019t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type . If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup > Validation > Mission Board > Sortie Type and pick a default SCL for your Sortie Types. Use Automatic Load Codes (formerly known as Auto SCL) Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code (formerly Auto SCL). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way: 1. Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, \u201cSortie\u201d would be fine. 2. Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. 3. PEX will generate a Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board, once a Tail Number is selected.

AFTO Form 781 Introduction Use PEX to log AFTO 781 Mission Data and Aircrew Data. That data can then be audited within PEX and exported to the ARMS database. Setup 1. In Training > Continuation > ARMs > Settings > ARMS Data > 781 Data: enter your unit\u2019s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781. 74 2. In Maintenance > Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number. 3. Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail #, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC (Mission Symbol) and Flight Authorization # 4. Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list. Implement In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule (SDS) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an \u201cAFTO 781\u201d link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. (They can also fill out their TAR.) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save. There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX: \u25a0 Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs. \u25a0 When a crewmember logs into PEX, on My Page, for every sortie, there is a 781 link, near the TAR link, which brings up the electronic 781. Fil out the PEX AFTO 781 1. Click on your sortie\u2019s 781 link to launch the PEX AFTO 781 dialog. 2. If you flew on more than one sortie, in the same tail number, on the same day, PEX provides you the option to include those sorties on a single AFTO 781. NOTE : ARMS uses only the Mission Number of the first flight in the sequence. 3. Fill out the Mission and Aircrew Data. Anyone can fill out the 781. NOTE : You can use one of three different mission numbers. To pick, click Select next to Mission Number at the top of the 781 dialog.

NOTE : If the tail number (or MDS) changed at the last minute, you can click on the ARMS MDS or ARMS Serial # Edit links at the top of the dialog and update. 4. The Aircraft Commander signs off the Pilot Review using their PEX PIN (mandatory). This readies the 781 for SARM audit and export to ARMS. 5.

This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below) Q: Where is the Apple App Store? \u00b6 A: Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an \"App Store,\" instead we have an \"App Catalog.\" All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved. Additonally, it simplifies the question \"Can I use App ____?\" . If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used. Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog? \u00b6 A: You may begin the process by sending an email to: 55og.efb@us.af.mil . However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the DISA Application Vetting Environment (DAVE) . Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out! \u00b6 A: Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings. Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? \u00b6 A: Yes. The correct, approved sync settings for the Aircrew Publications Library ( 55_OG ) will overwrite your notes and highlights. However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to \" ...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there... \" If you select create an annotated copy , GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your device's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will not be updated. The concern, from a Stan/Eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion. Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV. Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update? \u00b6 A: Yes. Please keep you device's software up-to-date. Any iOS software update that appears on your device (iOS settings > General > Software Update) is approved and should be applied. Occasionally, notices appear on the AF Portal and other official websites directing users to refrain from applying updates to mobile devices.

GoodReader can automatically sync individual files and entire folders from their remote versions hosted on the BOCKSCAR server. In GoodReader, all files and folders that are a part of the sync process are tagged with a special badge: You can choose whether or not you want to keep modified local files. This option may preserve notes that you've put over a PDF file, even if the corresponding remote file was deleted or modified on the server (Use this feature with caution. Please see I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync? in the Mobile FAQ). There are two different types of sync: normal sync and download-only. A normal sync is two-way. It keeps the contents of a local file or a folder identical to what you have on a server. During this process, GoodReader analyzes the contents of both local and remote folders and does the following: - Looks for modified files (for example, freshly annotated PDFs) on your device and uploads them to a server, replacing old ones there - Looks for modified files on a server and downloads them to your device, replacing old ones there - Looks for new files on a server and downloads them to your device - Looks for new local files and uploads them to a server - Looks for deleted files on a server that were previously present, and deletes them from your device. - Looks for deleted local files that were previously present, and deletes them from a server. A download-only sync is one-way, from the server to your device. It is a convenient distribution method for frequently-updated documents. This type of sync doesn't care what happens with your local files; It never puts anything on the server, never deletes anything from it, it only looks for new and modified remote files and downloads them as needed. When correctly configured, files that were deleted from the server will be deleted from your local device. The Aircrew Publications Library (APL) is a download-only sync. OGV maintains APL content on the BOCKSCAR server in a folder called 55_OG . Initial Setup \u00b6 For aircrew, this is usually done just before the device is issued to you. It only needs to be done once per each file/folder you wish to synchronize. All relevant remote files will be automatically downloaded to your device when doing the very first synchronization. Instructions for initial setup: Step 1: General App Settings \u00b6 First, set up general settings in GoodReader. Tap the Settings button on the main screen. Select the General Settings menu item. In General Settings , make the following changes: Turn off Use iCloud folder Turn off Use Downloads folder Make sure that Disable device auto-lock is on/enabled Step 2: Add the BOCKSCAR WebDAV server \u00b6 Next, add the BOCKSCAR server Tap the Connect button on the main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers , then the plus sign + to add a server. Select WebDAV Server . Configure the new WebDAV Server as follows: Readable Title: BOCKSCAR URL-address: pubs.bockscar.mil Turn on/enable Windows-style name encoding Turn off Use cookies Leave all the other fields/settings unchanged Tap Add . You should now see BOCKSCAR listed as a saved server. Step 3: Set up a Sync Folder \u00b6 Now that you have the server added, we\u2019ll need to configure GoodReader to sync with a folder on that server. Note 55 OG Aircrew should sync the 55_OG folder. If you\u2019re unsure, that\u2019s probably what you should select. You can come back anytime and sync additional folders. Note Double-check the Sync Parameter settings on step 9. Incorrect settings here are a common source of sync-related issues. Tap the Connect button on GoodReader's main screen. Tap to highlight Saved Servers. Select BOCKSCAR. A list of folders on the server are displayed. Tap to highlight the folder you\u2019d like to sync (We want to select the folder, not view its contents. So tap the folder name, not the > to the right of it). Tap Sync , at the bottom of the screen (Be careful not to tap Download if it is an option here.

We want the folder in your top/root directory, called My Documents , so do not select any sub-folders. Tap Download Here & Synchronize . If you see a Folder Already Exists pop-up, tap OK . Configure the Sync Parameters as follows: Turn on/enable Download only sync. Make sure Delete local files is on/enabled Turn on /enable \u2026even if they were edited .

GoodReader will now begin to sync that folder. You should see: Updating Synced Folders \u00b6 To make sure you have the latest publications/T.O.s/files, update your synced folder(s). During the update, any synced folders configured during initial setup will pull updates from the server. Connect to a BOCKSCAR Wi-Fi Access Point. Open GoodReader.

Background colors The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments. Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board. Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. Sortie Viewer \u00b6 Introduction The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' Note To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. Note To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. Note Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. Note The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. Note If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc. Sortie Viewer Menu File - Same as PEX Edit - Undo, Cut, Copy and Paste are non-functional this version. Clear Data \u2013 Removes all labels and data elements from the Selected Labels and Data Elements box. Also available as an icon on the menubar. View - Toolbar. Turns the Toolbar on and off.

The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. On the Selection Tab, \u201ddrag and drop\u201d Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven (7) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. Before using data elements from the Mission Events (ME) or Sortie Events (SE) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label \u201dShow\u201d to the top box. From that point on (until you drag another ME or SE Label), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the \u201dShow\u201d event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events \u201dScheduled Date\u201d and \u201dScheduled Time.\u201d Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag \"Show\" more than once. After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the \"extra\" label. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the \u201dTail#\u201d data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag \"Tail#.\" Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag \"Status\" and \"Parking.\" After using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions (or 'Entire Crew') before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' Note To increase the size allotted for a data element, \"drag and drop\" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, \"remarks\" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the \u201d[User Defined]\u201d label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. Note To display an air-refueling track name (e.g., AR101N), low-level route name (e.g., IR-644), a MOA name (e.g., Eglin 1), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the \u201dLocation\u201d for the appropriate Sortie Event (e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label (e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry) to the top grid followed by the \"Location\u201d data element. Note Do not use empty fields. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. Note The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. TTP In the header and footer areas, if you type in <br\\> it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says \"Additional Remarks\" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: On the IIS server Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. Click Apply. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. On the client Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. Note If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. TTP The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout (Header and Footer Information) needs to be coordinated across the various units.

See the PEX Install Guide for instructions. The HQ module should be instaled for use by MAJCOM HQs. It should not be installed at wing or squadron level. The HQ module is used by a HQ training office or functional manager to create a standardized set of Continuation Training tasks for subordinate units. It is also used to roll up Continuation Training and scheduling data from subordinate units. Controls Access these procedures by navigating to Headquarters. This wil not be present if not instal ed at your location. Build Continuation Training tasks for units Once the Headquarters module is installed, navigate to Headquarters > Training > Setup, and build Continuation Training tasks just like a local unit would. See the Continuation Training Setup help topic for detailed instructions. Send Continuation Training tasks to units When you are done building the Continuation Training tasks and are ready to provide them to subordinate units: Check the desired Tasks Right-click in the Training Tasks grid Select Export Selected Tasks and Save. PEX will generate a .dat file, with a Date Time stamp. An example filename is HQEvents-20160609014825.dat Send this file to your subordinate units and have them follow the Configure Continuation Training help topic instructions. Now that your units have a standardized Continuation Training task list, you will be able to see how they are all doing in Continuation Training. Register units with the HQ system Your units need to register with your HQ system. Send the units your HQ ePEX URL address and have them follow the Squadrons \u2013 HQ Registration help topic instructions. If you do not know the URL address, contact Comm. Go to Headquarters > Registered Units to see the registration status of your units. When a squadron has registered, a new row will appear and the Status field will show Waiting. To approve the squadron registration, highlight the row, click in the Waiting field, and select from the dropdown - Approved. Click off the row to save. The squadron is now registered and can start pushing Continuation Training or Scheduling data to the HQ. The only editable field on this page is Status. Al other data comes from the unit level. Build Continuation Training Tasks \u00b6 Introduction This module is used to create a set of standard training tasks that can be exported into a file and sent to subordinate units. Note Once a subordinate unit imports these tasks, they cannot be edited. That is by design, to ensure standardization. Build HQ Continuation Training Unit Tasks Login as PexAdmin. Only PexAdmin can build the tasks. In ePEX (only), go to Headquarters > Continuation Tng Tasks > Setup tab. Build the tasks just like building them outside of the HQ module. Instructions are found in the Configure Continuation Training help topic. Export the tasks to a file When your tasks are built, check the boxes for the tasks you want to export (select the box in the header to select all tasks). Right-click and select Export Selected Tasks. The resulting file can be distributed to subordinate units via email or download from a website. Import TACTICS data TACTICS is software used by the Joint Terminal Air Control (JTAC) community to track training. TACTICS data can be imported into PEX. To do so, a HQ Continuation Training Unit Task file needs to be built to mirror the training tasks in TACTICS. Using the TACTICS export file as a reference, the PEX Unit Task ID would be element #6, e.g., \u201cC00439\u201d. The Task ID must match exactly. The PEX Unit Task (name) would be element #7, e.g., \u201c1. Mission Organization of NAF/Group/Unit\u201d. The name does not have to match exactly and could be shortened, e.g., \u201c1. Msn Org NAF/Group/Unit\u201d. For more see TACTICS - Track JTAC Training . Rollup Continuation Training Tasks \u00b6 Introduction The Headquarters > Continuation Training Rollup pages are used by a HQ training functional manager for oversight of subordinate unit Continuation Training. PEX refers to HQ as MAJCOM and subordinate units as Squadrons. The module al ows the MAJCOM Training FM to view the most current training progress for all squadrons which are registered, approved, and sending Continuation Training data to MAJCOM.

The traditional menu commands in newer PEX modules have been replaced or supplemented by right-click \"context\" menus. PEX context menus perform a function in the grid where the mouse pointer is located when right clicked. A PEX grid is an area on the display with column headers, columns, and rows. The context menus include standard commands found in each of the new modules plus commands unique to the module in use. The standard commands are: Add - Adds a record to the current grid. Delete - Deletes the highlighted record of the current grid. Grid Settings - Allows you to hide or unhide columns, change the font size, or number of records to display per page for the current grid. Save Layout - Saves the changes you have made to the screen layout. Restore to Original - Returns the screen layout to the default layout. Export to Excel - Exports the grid to Excel (if installed). Print Grid - Prints the grid (if a printer is installed). Filter Grid - Filters the data based on a Column and user-entered text. PEX Environment \u00b6 PEX operates in an M$ Windows environment. Dark Gray Column Headings . Column headings that are a darker shade of gray than the others in a grid denote required entries before a particular line of data (record) can be saved to the database. Right-clicking . PEX makes extensive use of the right-click feature of the mouse, normally to add and delete data or to bring up menu items. Refresh Icon . With multiple windows (e.g., Mission Board, Resources Rainbow) open simultaneously, a change on one will not update the other(s) unless the other(s) are \u201drefreshed.\u201d The Refresh Icon is available on all windows for this purpose. Saving Data . To save data to the PEX database, it is not necessary to use a \u201dFile, Save\u201d type command as in MS Word or Excel. Once the required fields (indicated by dark gray column headings) in a line of data (record) are entered, all that is necessary to save the data is to click off the line of data to another line. Sorting Columns . Most columns within PEX can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column heading. Only one column can be chosen to sort at a time. The sorted column will rearrange the order of the remaining columns in the grid. You cannot add a new record once the columns have been sorted until you exit and reenter the application. ToolTip Notations . On numerous controls throughout PEX, if the cursor is rested on a control for a couple of seconds a ToolTip notation will appear with additional data associated with that control.
