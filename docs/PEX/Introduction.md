## What is PEX?

PEX, developed by USAF AFMC AFLCMC/HBBD, is a software suite of applications that coordinates the Scheduling, Training, Stan Eval, and Aircraft Status activities of unit-level operational military aerospace units, such as aeromedical, air control, air operations centers, flying, ICBM, intelligence, joint terminal air control, pararescue, and security forces units. PEX is used to facilitate data sharing across the functional areas in a squadron, and is used worldwide by over 1000 squadron level units, including all AF MAJCOMs, Australia, and Poland.
