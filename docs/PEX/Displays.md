# Displays

## Calendar Viewer

**Introduction**  
The Calendar Viewer displays Mission, Sortie, Personnel, and Aircraft Commitments in a calendar format, with four different calendar options: Month, Bi-Week, Week, and Day.

**Permissions**  
The permission roles allowed to create Calendar Viewer filters are Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, Operations Desk, Operations Staff, Training Administrator, and Administrator.

**Setup the Calendar Viewer**  
On each tab, click the Display Options icon to select the data you want to see. 

* _Group View_ - The Group view groups the commitments together by Commitment Type.
* _Individual View_ - The Individual View provides more detailed data on each individual commitment.

!!! note "Note"
     Even if you show only a few details, hovering the cursor over a commitment provides all Commitment Details via a tool-tip. 

**Use the Calendar Viewer**  
The Calendar Viewer is used to see the schedule in order to make decisions. A small red arrow appended to the last entry of a day cell indicates that there are more entries for that day that could not be displayed due to the view’s space restrictions. To see these entries, click on the red arrow to change the display view.

* _Mission Tab_ - Right-click on a mission to Hot Link to Mission Board \(WinPEX only\).
* _Sortie Tab_ - Right-click on a sortie to Hot Link to Mission Board \(WinPEX only\) and/or View Sortie Details.
* _Personnel Tab_ - Right-click on a person to Hot Link to Commitments Board - Personnel \(WinPEX only\).
* _Aircraft Tab_ - Right-click on an aircraft to Hot Link to Commitments Board – Aircraft \(WinPEX only\).
  
**Background Colors**  
The colors indicate the Commitment Type. Click the Color Legend icon to see their definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board.

**Calendar Viewer differences between ePEX and WinPEX**  
The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX Calendar Viewer. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right.

## My PEX

### My PEX Basics

**Introduction**    
Mobile-friendly My PEX currently supplements, and will replace, My Page as your portal into PEX. From My PEX you can view and manage matters relating to User Preferences, Go/No-Go, training, your schedule, and required signatures.

**Permissions**    
Basic users can access all functionality in My PEX.

!!! note "Note"
    If you are scheduled for an event "owned" by another unit, that event will appear in your calendar. Your visibility into the event may be limited by your permission level in that unit.

**Rules**    
My PEX interfaces with multiple modules throughout PEX. Scheduling information interfaces only with the Scheduler. Information from legacy scheduling modules \(Flying Schedule, Commitments Board, etc.\) is viewable on My Page.

**Module Notes**    
My PEX uses responsive design to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge how pages display on multiple devices; desktops, tablets, and phones. These instructions describe how PEX displays on a desktop monitor. Depending on the device used, some features and controls may appear compressed. All functionality is present regardless of the device used.

**Controls**    
Access My PEX by logging into PEX, or navigate to Displays > My PEX. If, when logging into PEX, you still land on the legacy My Page, go to My Preferences \(top right\), Default Home Page, select the My PEX radio button, and click Save Preferences.

**Introduction**

My page is your main portal into PEX. This page brings together information about you onto a single screen. My Page displays your commitments, certifications, continuation training tasks, qualification training courses/task lists, evaluations, availability, read file items, and No-Go status. From My Page, you can report accomplished training, manage personal commitments and availability, bid on trips/sorties, report flight data, sign off read file items, and review qualification training progress.

You can also update your personal data, create favorite links, and change your PEX preferences. A supervisor can view the evaluation and training folders of their subordinates and send out To-Do lists.

**Header Information**

* _Location_ - PEX uses this location to convert Zulu times to your local time. If you are in a different location than what is listed, click on the location to change it.
* _Go/No-Go_ - Clicking on the tabs allows you to see No-Go details. A green tab indicates Go status. A red tab indicates No-Go status. A yellow tab indicates something that requires attention but doesn’t prevent you from accomplishing the mission, usually under supervision.
* _My Preferences_ - Allows you to set your primary \(default\) squadron and Security Identifier. Your Security Identifier is used to sign off read file items and for aircraft commanders to sign off AFTO 781s. The page also displays your PEX permissions.
* _My Personal Data_ - Allows you to view your data from the Personnel module. It also allows you to update your Contact tab information.
* _My Links_ - Allows you to create up to ten user-defined and up to ten squadron-defined web pages. On the My Links page, select Settings, Edit Links. From this dialog you can enter and edit user-defined links. If you have the PEX administrator role, the Edit Squadron Links on My Page wil display here. You would be able to enter and edit links for the squadron.
* _To Do List_ - Allows you to email and/or print a list of things to do based on data in PEX. As a supervisor, you can send To Do lists to your subordinates.

1-month and 3-month RAP Lookback, and a 7/30/60/90 day Flying Hour summary are available, when those functions are configured, in a new grid above the Commitments schedule. For each, the grid is not visible if not configured.

* _RAP Lookback_ - To view RAP Lookback, your primary MDS and crew position must be set in Setup > Personnel > Quals, and RAP must be set in [Training > Continuation > Setup > RAP Requirements](). The [ARMS training import]() must be current to accurately reflect lookback. The grid displays the number of RAP sorties flown in 1 month and 3 months. For each, if RAP was met the field is green. If RAP was not met the field is pink.  
![rap_lookback](img/Displays/rap_lookback.jpg){: style="height:30%;width:30%"}

* _Flying Hours_ - summary. To view the summary, the 7/30/60/90 day preferences Less Than and Greater Than must be set, and Use on My Page & GNG must be checked, in [Training > Continuation > Setup > Unit Settings]().

**View my schedule**   
At the top of My Page, PEX gives you a five-day view of your schedule. Calendar controls allow you to select which five days to view. PEX displays all your commitments, including sorties and shifts, from any squadron in the database. Each commitment has an Ack \(Acknowledge\) checkbox. When you check this Ack box, it lets the schedulers know you know about the commitment. When checked, a dialog asks if you’d like to schedule the commitment in Outlook. This functionality may be blocked by USAF. If you use PEX off of the USAF domain, select Yes to add the commitment to your Outlook calendar. If you’re scheduled on a Sortie, click the blue Sortie link for the Sortie displayed for that day. This provides you with details about the sortie. If the sortie is in a formation, you will also be able to view your wingman’s details.

## Resources Rainbow

**Introduction**

The Resources Rainbow displays Aircraft, Location, Mission, Personnel, and Squadron Commitments in a spreadsheet format. Basic User permissions are sufficient to view the Resources Rainbow.

**Permissions**

The permission roles allowed to create Resources Rainbow filters are Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, Operations Desk, Operations Staff, Training Administrator, or Administrator.

**Setup the Resources Rainbow**

On each ePEX tab, click the Display Options icon to select the data you want to see. In WinPEX, click the icons.

* _Committed Resources_ - Shows only scheduled resources

* _All Resources_ - Shows unscheduled resources, in addition to scheduled resources.

* _Availability_ - For people who entered Personnel Availability, their availability information is viewable on the Day and Week views. Availability does not show in the Month view. 

**Use the Resources Rainbow**

The Resources Rainbow is used to see the schedule in order to make decisions. When there is only one commitment in a time cell, the number 1 is not shown so that the display is not cluttered with a bunch of ones. When there is more than one commitment within a time cel , the number of commitments is shown. To display details about the commitment\(s\), click on the commitment cell.

The commitment\(s\) details will display in the Commitment Table. To clear the Commitment Table, click the Clear button.

* _Aircraft Tab_ - Right-click on an aircraft commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board – Aircraft \(WinPEX only\). 

* _Mission Tab_ - Right-click on a mission to Hot Link to Mission Board \(WinPEX only\).

* _Personnel Tab_ - Right-click on a person commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board - Personnel \(WinPEX only\).

**Background colors**

The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments.

Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board.

**Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX**

The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. 

## Sortie Viewer

**Introduction**

The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Full Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory.

  1. On the Selection Tab, ”drag and drop” Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven \(7\) data elements down. There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right.
  2. Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels.
  3. Before using data elements from the Mission Events \(ME\) or Sortie Events \(SE\) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes.

For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label ”Show” to the top box. From that point on \(until you drag another ME or SE Label\), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the ”Show” event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events ”Scheduled Date” and ”Scheduled Time.” Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag "Show" more than once.

After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the "extra" label. 

  1. Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the ”Tail\#” data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for.

For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag "Tail\#." Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag "Status" and "Parking."

4. After using the ”\[User Defined\]” label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element.

5. To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions \(or 'Entire Crew'\) before selecting 'Crew Remarks.'

!!! note "Note"
    To increase the size allotted for a data element, "drag and drop" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, "remarks" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the ”\[User Defined\]” label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels.

!!! note "Note"
    To display an air-refueling track name \(e.g., AR101N\), low-level route name \(e.g., IR-644\), a MOA name \(e.g., Eglin 1\), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the ”Location” for the appropriate Sortie Event \(e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point\). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label \(e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry\) to the top grid followed by the "Location” data element.
!!! note "Note"
    Do not use empty fields.

6. Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab.

7. Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager.

!!! note "Note"
    The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately.

!!! tip "Tip"
    In the header and footer areas, if you type in `<br\>` it will force a line break in your final display. The area that says "Additional Remarks" can be used as a third area to enter remarks.

8. Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps:

**On the IIS server**

1. Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory.
2. Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option.
3. Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name.
4. Click Apply.
5. Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab.
6. Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK.
7.  On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights.

**On the client**

1. Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share
2. In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server

As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh.

!!! note "Note"
    If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username.

!!! tip "Tip"
     The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout \(Header and Footer Information\) needs to be coordinated across the various units.

3. Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc. 

**Sortie Viewer Menu**

* File - Same as PEX
