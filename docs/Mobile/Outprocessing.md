# Turning In Your IPad

---

When it is time for you to PCS/Seperate/Retire, you will need to return your iPad to us. Before you do, please accomplish the following:

1. Ensure your iPad is clean and servicable and is 100% charged.
2. Bring back the external cover even if it is cracked or broken. Please do not throw away.
3. Return the charger and cable that was issued to you. If you have lost or misplaced these items, below is a list of approved replacements. You must bring in a charger before we will accept your EFB.

Once we have all items in hand, we will clear your VMPF checklist, please give us a few days to clear VMPF. If it is not cleared within 3 days after you have turned in your EFB, please call and remind us.
