# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** Can I add my AppleID to my device?

**A:** Yes, You can Configure your AppleID. This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below)

**Q:** Where is the Apple App Store?

**A:** Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an "App Store," instead we have an "App Catalog."  
All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved.  
Additonally, it simplifies the question _"Can I use App \_\_\_\_?"_. If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used.

**Q:** How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog?

**A:** You may begin the process by sending an email to: `55og.efb@us.af.mil`.however, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. 

Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the [DISA Application Vetting Environment \(DAVE\)](https://dave.disa.mil).

**Q:** I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync?

**A:** Yes. The correct, approved sync settings will overwrite your notes and highlights. 

However, When you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to "_...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there..._" I you select `create an annotated copy`, GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes. The problem here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite the original file with the new version...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will _not_ be updated. The concern, from a stan/eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion.  

It is your responsibility to ensure that your device is synced and configured correctly before performing flying duties. Direct any questions comments, or concerns with your squadron stan/eval section or OGV.
