# Frequently Asked Questions

---

#### Q: Can I get official email on my mobile device?

**A:** Yes. We can install pki certificates on your device that will allow you to access email and most sites that require a CAC. However, you are only able to access if you are to the BOCKSCAR network.

---

#### Q: What do I do if my mobile device is involved in a classified message incident?

**A:** Place the device into airplane mode. Contact us immediately. Do _not_ power off the device, attempt to delete emails/files, or erase the device.

!!! danger "Warning"
     Your device's email is synced with your email account. So even if you were not on your device/EFB at the time of the incident, you still need to do the above.

#### Q: Can I add my AppleID to my device?

**A:** Yes, You can Configure your AppleID. This is helpful if you intend to use Apple Music, Apple News+, or Apple Podcasts. It is not required for any official function, and it will not give access to any additional applications not already approved for use. (See Below)

---

#### Q: Where is the Apple App Store?

**A:** Due to Security Requirements, all applications are carefully vetted through a series of channels and processes. To ensure this is done properly, we do not have an "App Store," instead we have an "App Catalog."  
All applications placed within have been extensively tested, documented, and approved.  
Additonally, it simplifies the question _"Can I use App \_\_\_\_?"_. If the app is in the App Catalog, it may be used.

#### Q: How do I request an app to added to the App Catalog?

**A:** You may begin the process by sending an email to: `55og.efb@us.af.mil`. However, there is a considerable delay to this process, as we primarily focus on those apps necessary to accomplish our primary missions. 

Alternatively, you can search the current app vetting pipeline by navigating to the [DISA Application Vetting Environment \(DAVE\)](https://dave.disa.mil).

#### Q: I forgot my device's passcode. I'm locked out!

**A:** Visit our offices during customer service hours and we'll unlock your device. Be aware that unlocking the device may involve a reset of all you files/settings.

---

#### Q: I made notes/highlights to publications in GoodReader. Will they be lost when I sync?

**A:** Yes. The correct, approved sync settings for the Aircrew Publications Library (`55_OG`) will overwrite your notes and highlights.

However, when you make highlights/notes in a file using GoodReader, it may ask if you want to "_...create a seperate copy of the file, and save changes there..._" If you select `create an annotated copy`, GoodReader will create a copy of that file that contains your highlights/notes.

The potential issue here is that when a new checklist or publication is released, a sync will overwrite your device's original file with the new version from the server...and the seperate, annotated copy you created will _not_ be updated. The concern, from a Stan/Eval perspecive, is that the outdated copy will continue to be used or that duplicate copies could cause confusion.  

Ulimately, it is your responsibility to ensure current and complete publications are used while performing flying duties. Direct any questions, comments, or concerns to your squadron stan/eval section or OGV.

#### Q: An iOS update is available for my device. Can I update?

**A:** Yes. Please keep you device's software up-to-date. Any iOS software update that appears on your device (iOS settings > General > Software Update) is approved and should be applied.  

Occasionally, notices appear on the AF Portal and other official websites directing users to refrain from applying updates to mobile devices. These usually apply to devices that are operated under _different_ AF/MDM programs and do not apply to devices managed by OMNI/Project BOCKSCAR.

---

#### Q: What do I do if my case or screen cracks/breaks?

**A:** If your case is broken or cracked, please bring it back to us and we will issue you a new one. Please do not throw them away (we get them replaced under warranty). The same goes for cracked screen. Please bring it in to us as soon as you notice the cracked screen so we can fix it before it gets worse. We'll probably issue you a repalcment on the spot and take your broken device in for repairs.
