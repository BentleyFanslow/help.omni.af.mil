## About Email on EFBs  
You can access email, PEX, and other sites that require a CAC login on your EFB after you have your DoD certs downloaded and installed on your device. Currently, you can only access these sites while on the BOCKSCAR network. We are working on global access, but do not have an ETA as of yet.
