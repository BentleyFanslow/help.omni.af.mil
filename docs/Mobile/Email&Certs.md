# DoD Certs For Email And PEX

## About Email on EFBs  
You can access email, PEX, and other sites that require a CAC login on your EFB after you have your DoD certs downloaded and installed on your device. Currently, you can only access these sites while on the BOCKSCAR network. We are working on global access, but do not have an ETA as of yet. 

## Purebred  
We use a website and App combo called Purebred to download and install certs onto the EFBs. The Purebred website can be found at [purebred.csd.disa.mil](http://purebred.csd.disa.mil/) and the Purebred App is found in your support folder on your EFB. Before you install any certs on the EFB, ensure that the Purebred app is updated to the most current version. The current version can be seen at [Mobile Device Baseline](Status.md#mobile-device-baseline) on the Status page.
