**What is PEX? **

PEX, developed by USAF AFMC AFLCMC/HBBD, is a software suite of applications that coordinates the Scheduling, Training, Stan Eval, and Aircraft Status activities of unit-level operational military aerospace units, such as aeromedical, air control, air operations centers, flying, ICBM, intelligence, joint terminal air control, pararescue, and security forces units. PEX is used to facilitate data sharing across the functional areas in a squadron. PEX is used worldwide by over 1000 squadron level units, including all AF MAJCOMs, Australia, and Poland. 

To use PEX, you must first log in. To log in, you must either be at a computer which has the **WinPEX** client installed \(double-click the desktop launch icon\) or use a web browser and navigate to **ePEX** web application. Both WinPEX 

and ePEX take you to the same PEX database. ePEX contains all PEX functionality, except flight scheduling. All offices, except flight scheduling, should use ePEX. Flight scheduling offices, to make use of the WinPEX-only Mission Board, should instal and use WinPEX. 

3 

PEX 

**NOTE**: Both WinPEX and ePEX take you to the same database. 

To login to ePEX, navigate to the login page via a web address \(URL\) that’s provided to you via an email, link, in some sort of squadron/group/wing web page, or some other means of distributing a URL. At the login page, accept the consent banner, verify the name listed in the “Connect To:” button, and click the login button. If you’re able to login to more than one database, clicking the “connect to:” dropdown will provide a list of those databases. Select the appropriate name and click “login.” The last database that you’ve successfully logged into will be the defaulted name for your subsequent logins. 

If no connections are listed in ePEX, contact your local PexAdmin and let them know that you have no connections available. They in turn wil configure the ePEX server for the necessary connections. 

Logging into WinPEX as a machine administrator: If you’re a machine administrator, you have the ability to import the connection file for all user profiles of a machine. Click the WinPEX icon, dismiss the CAUTION about the missing connection file, accept the consent message, and at the login dialog click “import connections file.” Select Save as all users radio button. Navigate to the configuration file and save it accepting the default file name and location. 

After this the connect to button will populate for all existing user profiles on that machine. 

**CAUTION**: Do not change the default file name or save location. This will prevent you from logging in. 

Logging into WinPEX as a non-privileged user: you’ll need to import a configuration file the first time you login after migration. This file should be sent to you by your PEX Administrator. Click the WinPEX icon, dismiss the CAUTION 

about the missing connection file, accept the consent message, and at the login dialog click “import connections file.” Select Save as current user radio button. Navigate to the configuration file and save it accepting the default file name and location. 

**CAUTION**: Do not change the default file name or save location. This will prevent you from logging in. 

**NOTE**: If you don’t have machine administrator permissions, selecting “all users” radio button will fail to a message letting you know you don’t have the necessary rights to instal the file for other users. 

Once the file saves, you should now see the database name listed in the “connect to:” dropdown. Select it and click login to start using WinPEX. . If you’re able to login to more than one database, clicking the “connect to:” dropdown will provide a list of those databases. Select the appropriate name and click “login.” The last database that you’ve successful y logged into wil be the defaulted name for your subsequent logins. 

**NOTE**: If no database name is visible in the dropdown, this means a PEX account has not been set up for you, or there’s something wrong with the PEX service host. Contact your local PEX administrator for assistance. 

**NOTE**: If you have multiple login accounts in a database, they’l show up after you hit the login button just like they’ve done before the new login procedure. 

If you have existing connections file and you’re sent a new one, click the import connections file and navigate to the new file. Once the file is selected you’l be asked if you want to overwrite or merge the existing file. Selecting 

“overwrite” wil erase existing connections and the file wil be overwritten with the connections from the new file. 

Selecting “merge” wil retain existing connections and adds the content of the new file. 

**CAUTION**: Exiting WinPEX could be as simple as closing the program with the red X close icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen. You are cautioned to not use this technique but rather to close the individual modules \(applications\) running within the client and then use the file menu item "Logout." This is to ensure there are no applications running in the background which would remain connected to the database and server.

**New PEX Modules **

All PEX modules will be rewritten in more advanced computer languages as they become available. The traditional menu commands in newer PEX modules have been replaced or supplemented by right-click "context" menus. PEX 

context menus perform a function in the grid where the mouse pointer is located when right clicked. A PEX grid is an area on the display with column headers, columns, and rows. The context menus include standard commands found in each of the new modules plus commands unique to the module in use. The standard commands are: **Add**. Adds a record to the current grid. 

**Delete**. Deletes the highlighted record of the current grid. 

**Grid Settings**. Al ows you to hide or unhide columns, change the font size, or number of records to display per page for the current grid. 

**Save Layout**. Saves the changes you have made to the screen layout. 

**Restore to Original**. Returns the screen layout to the default layout. 

**Export to Excel**. Exports the grid to Excel \(if installed\). 

5 

PEX 

**Print Grid**. Prints the grid \(if a printer is installed\). 

**Filter Grid**. Filters the data based on a Column and user-entered text. 

**PEX Environment **

PEX operates in an MS Windows environment. 

**Dark Gray Column Headings**. Column headings that are a darker shade of gray than the others in a grid denote required entries before a particular line of data \(record\) can be saved to the database. 

**Right-clicking**. PEX makes extensive use of the right-click feature of the mouse, normally to add and delete data or to bring up menu items. 

**Refresh Icon**. With multiple windows \(e.g., Mission Board, Resources Rainbow\) open simultaneously, a change on one will not update the other\(s\) unless the other\(s\) are ”refreshed.” The Refresh Icon is available on all windows for this purpose. 

**Saving Data**. To save data to the PEX database, it is not necessary to use a ”File, Save” type command as in MS Word or Excel. Once the required fields \(indicated by dark gray column headings\) in a line of data \(record\) are entered, all that is necessary to save the data is to click off the line of data to another line. 

**Sorting Columns**. Most columns within PEX can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column heading. Only one column can be chosen to sort at a time. The sorted column will rearrange the order of the remaining columns in the grid. You cannot add a new record once the columns have been sorted until you exit and reenter the application. 

**ToolTip Notations**. On numerous controls throughout PEX, if the cursor is rested on a control for a couple of seconds a ToolTip notation will appear with additional data associated with that control. 

**Light Gray Shading**. If a data field is shaded light-gray, that indicates the field is non-editable. 

**Line Highlighting for Selected Items**. To change the color used for highlighting selected items on your computer: right-click on your Desktop, select Properties, Appearance Tab, Item drop-down, Selected Items, and Color dropdown. Select a new color for the Item and Font. Click OK.

**Headquarters **

**Headquarters Overview **

**Introduction **

The Headquarters \(HQ\) module is installed separately from regular PEX. See the PEX Install Guide for instructions. The HQ module should be instal ed for use by MAJCOM HQs. It should not be instal ed at wing or squadron level. The HQ module is used by a HQ training office or functional manager to create a standardized set of Continuation Training tasks for subordinate units. It is also used to rol up Continuation Training and scheduling data from subordinate units. 

**Controls **

Access these procedures by navigating to Headquarters. This wil not be present if not instal ed at your location. 

**Build Continuation Training tasks for units **

Once the Headquarters module is installed, navigate to Headquarters > Training > Setup, and build Continuation Training tasks just like a local unit would. See the Continuation Training Setup help topic for detailed instructions. 

**Send Continuation Training tasks to units **

When you are done building the Continuation Training tasks and are ready to provide them to subordinate units: 

**1. ** Check the desired Tasks 

**2. ** Right-click in the Training Tasks grid 

**3. ** Select Export Selected Tasks and Save. 

**4. ** PEX will generate a .dat file, with a Date Time stamp. An example filename is HQEvents-20160609014825.dat. 

**5. ** Send this file to your subordinate units and have them fol ow the Configure Continuation 

Training help topic instructions. 

Now that your units have a standardized Continuation Training task list, you will be able to see how they are all doing in Continuation Training. 

**Register units with the HQ system **

Your units need to register with your HQ system. 

**1. ** Send the units your HQ ePEX URL address and have them fol ow the Squadrons – HQ 

Registration help topic instructions. If you do not know the URL address, contact Comm. Go to Headquarters > Registered Units to see the registration status of your units. 

**2. ** When a squadron has registered, a new row will appear and the Status field will show Waiting. 

**3. ** To approve the squadron registration, highlight the row, click in the Waiting field, and select from the dropdown - Approved. 

**4. ** Click off the row to save. 

7 

Headquarters 

The squadron is now registered and can start pushing Continuation Training or Scheduling data to the HQ. The only editable field on this page is Status. Al other data comes from the unit level. 

**Build Continuation Training Tasks **

**Introduction **

This module is used to create a set of standard training tasks that can be exported into a file and sent to subordinate units. 

**NOTE: **Once a subordinate unit imports these tasks, they cannot be edited. That is by design, to ensure standardization. 

**Build HQ Continuation Training Unit Tasks **

**1. ** Login as PexAdmin. Only PexAdmin can build the tasks. 

**2. ** In ePEX \(only\), go to Headquarters > Continuation Tng Tasks > Setup tab. 

**3. ** Build the tasks just like building them outside of the HQ module. Instructions are found in the Configure Continuation Training help topic. 

**Export the tasks to a file **

When your tasks are built, check the boxes for the tasks you want to export \(select the box in the header to select all tasks\). Right-click and select Export Selected Tasks. The resulting file can be distributed to subordinate units via email or download from a website. 

**Import TACTICS data **

TACTICS is software used by the Joint Terminal Air Control \(JTAC\) community to track training. 

TACTICS data can be imported into PEX. To do so, a HQ Continuation Training Unit Task file needs to be built to mirror the training tasks in TACTICS. Using the TACTICS export file as a reference, the PEX Unit Task ID would be element \#6, e.g., “C00439”. The Task ID must match exactly. The PEX Unit Task \(name\) would be element \#7, e.g., “1. Mission Organization of NAF/Group/Unit”. The name does not have to match exactly and could be shortened, e.g., “1. Msn Org NAF/Group/Unit”. For more see TACTICS - Track JTAC Training.  

**Rollup Continuation Training Tasks **

**Introduction **

The Headquarters > Continuation Training Rollup pages are used by a HQ training functional manager for oversight of subordinate unit Continuation Training. PEX refers to HQ as MAJCOM and subordinate units as Squadrons. The module al ows the MAJCOM Training FM to view the most current training progress for all squadrons which are registered, approved, and sending Continuation Training data to MAJCOM. 

**NOTE**: Access to the HQ module is control ed. Contact the PEX Help Desk to get a copy of the instruction, “How to Enable the Headquarters Module”. 

**Navigation **

From the PEX menu, select Headquarters > Continuation Tng Rol up. The page has two tabs: Overview and Tasks. In the Overview tab, you wil create views that display the training data in which you are interested.

Displays 

**Resources Rainbow **

**Introduction **

The Resources Rainbow displays Aircraft, Location, Mission, Personnel, and Squadron Commitments in a spreadsheet format. Basic User permissions are sufficient to view the Resources Rainbow. 

**Permissions **

The permission roles allowed to create Resources Rainbow filters are Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, Operations Desk, Operations Staff, Training Administrator, or Administrator. 

**Setup the Resources Rainbow **

On each ePEX tab, click the Display Options icon to select the data you want to see. In WinPEX, click the icons. 

**Committed Resources. ** Shows only scheduled resources 

**Al Resources. ** Shows unscheduled resources, in addition to scheduled resources. 

**Availability. ** For people who entered Personnel Availability, their availability information is viewable on the Day and Week views. Availability does not show in the Month view. 

**Use the Resources Rainbow **

The Resources Rainbow is used to see the schedule in order to make decisions. When there is only one commitment in a time cell, the number 1 is not shown so that the display is not cluttered with a bunch of ones. When there is more than one commitment within a time cel , the number of commitments is shown. To display details about the commitment\(s\), click on the commitment cell. 

The commitment\(s\) details will display in the Commitment Table. To clear the Commitment Table, click the Clear button. 

**Aircraft Tab. ** Right-click on an aircraft commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board – 

Aircraft \(WinPEX only\). 

**Mission Tab. ** Right-click on a mission to Hot Link to Mission Board \(WinPEX only\). 

**Personnel Tab. ** Right-click on a person commitment to Hot Link to Commitments Board - 

Personnel \(WinPEX only\). 

**Background colors **

The colors indicate the Commitment Type; except for red, which indicates conflicting commitments. 

Multiple, non-overlapping, commitments are displayed in light blue. Click the Color Legend icon to see the definitions. The colors come from Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Commitments Board. 

**Resources Rainbow differences between ePEX and WinPEX **

The main difference is filters cannot be created in ePEX. They can be used in ePEX but must be created in the WinPEX CV. Another slight difference is the placement of control icons. In WinPEX they are at upper-left. In ePEX they are at upper-right. 

**Sortie Viewer **

**Introduction **

The Sortie Viewer module allows you to design and then electronically display user-defined schedule data. The Ful Screen View can be displayed on computer monitors, TV screens, LCD projectors, or 20 

plasma screens. The Sortie Viewer Template Manager allows you to save Sortie Viewer designs. The ePEX Sortie Viewer displays the output file created and distributed by WinPEX. To make the ePEX 

Sortie Viewer work, within the WinPEX Sortie Viewer, identify a Full Screen Display Output Path File to the web server's ePEX directory or alternatively to a shared directory and configure I S to read the file into the web server's ePEX directory. 

**1. ** On the Selection Tab, ”drag and drop” Available Labels and Data Elements from the list boxes below into the Selected Labels and Data Elements box above. The Selected Labels and Data Elements box can display up to 16 data elements across and seven \(7\) data elements down. 

There are a few rules that must be followed in order to get your display to come out right. 

**1. ** Elements from the following list boxes can be used without restriction: Missions, Sorties, Crew Position, and Custom Labels. 

**2. ** Before using data elements from the Mission Events \(ME\) or Sortie Events \(SE\) list boxes, you must select the event identifier label from the Mission or Sortie Events Labels list boxes. 

For example, say you want to display the Sortie Show Date/Time: from the SE Labels list box, drag the label ”Show” to the top box. From that point on \(until you drag another ME or SE Label\), everything you drag from the SE list box will relate to the ”Show” event. Using our example, from the SE list box, drag the events ”Scheduled Date” and ”Scheduled Time.” Caution: Drag the same Label only once per display, e.g., don't drag "Show" more than once. 

After dragging the label up to the top area, entries from the ME or SE list can be dragged on top of the label, if desired to eliminate the "extra" label. 

**3. ** Before using data elements from the Aircraft or Aircraft Status list boxes, you must select the ”Tail\#” data element from the Sorties list box. That way PEX knows which aircraft you want the data for. 

For example, say you want to display aircraft status and parking location: from the Sorties list box, drag "Tail\#." Then from the Aircraft Status list box drag "Status" and "Parking." 

**4. ** After using the ”\[User Defined\]” label, you must tab/click out of the field before dragging another label/data element. 

**5. ** To display crewmember remarks, select all of the desired crew positions \(or 'Entire Crew'\) before selecting 'Crew Remarks.' 

**NOTE:** To increase the size allotted for a data element, "drag and drop" the same data element next to the original and the size wil be doubled. Do it a third time and the space is tripled and so on. This works for any data element, however, "remarks" will only display a limited size with the entire remark visible in a roll over tool tip. Using the ”\[User Defined\]” label from the Custom Labels list box allows you to create your own labels. 

**NOTE:** To display an air-refueling track name \(e.g., AR101N\), low-level route name \(e.g., IR-644\), a MOA name \(e.g., Eglin 1\), etc., you need to ensure back in the Mission Board that the name is included as part of the ”Location” for the appropriate Sortie Event \(e.g., AR Initial Point, LL Entry Point, MOA Entry Point\). Then, in Sortie Viewer, drag the appropriate Sortie Event Label \(e.g., ARIP, LLEP, or MOA Entry\) to the top grid followed by the "Location” data element. 

**NOTE:** Do not use empty fields. 

**6. ** Once you have completed your Labels and Data Elements, save your design using Tools, Template Manger, and then select the Layout tab. 

21 

Displays 

**7. ** Modify the Header and Footer data to your liking. The Header and Footer always remain in view in the Ful Screen mode. The Footer is a useful place to display takeoff and landing data. 

Once you have completed your Layout, save your design by using Tools, Template Manager. 

**NOTE:** The templates for the Selection tab and Layout tab are independent of each other. They are managed separately. 

**TTP:** In the header and footer areas, if you type in "<br>" it will force a line break in your final display. 

The area that says "Additional Remarks" can be used as a third area to enter remarks. 

**8. ** Select your desired Ful Screen Options and Preview your design. Click Save to save your preferred Full Screen Options. Identifying a Full Screen Display Output File Path on a shared directory allows other network users to view the display without having PEX software installed on their computer. Placing the file on the ePEX web server allows access via the Sortie Viewer display in ePEX . In order to enable this option you must take the following steps: **On the IIS server **

**1. ** Explore to the C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot directory. 

**2. ** Right click on the ePEX directory and choose the Sharing and Security menu option. 

**3. ** Click the 'Share this folder' radio button and accept the default Share name. 

**4. ** Click Apply. 

**5. ** Click the Permissions button on the Sharing tab. 

**6. ** Give Everyone 'Ful control' and Click OK. 

**7. ** On the security permissions tab give Domain Users 'Modify' rights. 

**On the client **

**1. ** Map a drive to the newly created ePEX share 

**2. ** In the Ful Screen Display Output File Path browse to the ePEX directory of the ePEX web server 

As long as the WinPEX client is in Full Screen mode the sortie Viewer in ePEX will be updated at the specified refresh rate. If the client is taken out of Full Screen mode then the display in ePEX will display the last information sent and will not refresh. 

**NOTE:** If you need to restrict access to the web server the administrator could create a specific active directory group and give the 'Full Control' share and 'Modify' security permissions to that group, then give group membership to specific domain users. It is the network user name which requires access to the share, not the PEX username. 

**TTP:** The Sortie Viewer can display one Squadron or Al Squadrons. In ePEX you cannot determine the selection layout. Therefore, if the ePEX Sortie Viewer is to be used, then the selection of labels and data elements, as well as the Layout \(Header and Footer Information\) needs to be coordinated across the various units. 

**3. ** Select View, Full Screen or click the Full Screen icon. To print the Full Screen View, right-click and select Print. To exit Ful Screen mode, press Esc.

**Ops **

**Binders **

**Introduction **

The Binders module al ows you to create and maintain electronic binders for purposes such as program continuity, self-assessment, mobility, etc. It is accessed through the PEX main menu via Ops>Binders. The Binders module is divided into two sections, Binders and Setup. The Setup page al ows you to create different Binder Types and Documentation Folders to setup your binders. The Binders page allows you to create binders; associate owners and alternate owners to the binder; import and export binders and add observations and documents to a binder. PEX al ows you to create different binder types such as Self-Assessment, Continuity, etc. This enables you to establish a standardized documentation folders structure for each binder type. 

A Self-Assessment binder type with its associated documentation folders is delivered with PEX 

software. 

**Permissions **

Two \(2\) permission roles and four \(4\) pseudo-roles can access Binders, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator: 

■ Binder Administrator can perform every function in the module and can access and manage every binder for each squadron in which they are assigned the role. 

■ Binder Read Only is able to access and view every binder in the squadron\(s\) to which they are assigned the role, but they cannot perform any of the functions. 

■ The following are pseudo-roles, assigned from within the binder. The purpose of these pseudo-roles is to allow personnel with no other Binder roles to be able to access and work in the specific binder\(s\) in which they are assigned the pseudo-role: 

• Binder Owner – Able to manage documentation and observations. Unlike Binder Administrator, the only binder function at the top of the Binders page which they can execute is documenting and viewing Binder Reviews. 

• Alternate – Able to manage documentation and observations. Also able to document and view Binder Reviews. 

• Self-Assessment Program Manager \(SAPM\). Able to manage documentation and observations. Also able to document and view Binder Reviews. 

• Binder Read Only Alternate. Able to view all documentation and observations. 

Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Binder Owners are set in the Binder Details. 

Alternates, SAPMs, and Binder Read Only Alternates are assigned via Binders > Manage Alternates. 

**Rules **

■ Binder Types cannot be deleted if a squadron in the database is using the binder type. 

25 

!(images/000053.jpg)

Ops 

**Module Notes **

■ Binders interfaces with the Personnel module for the purposes of assigning Owners and Alternates. 

■ Binders interfaces with the Squadron module for the purpose of selecting a Squadron to which a binder belongs. 

**Workspace **

These features are accessed from the PEX Main Menu by navigating to Ops > Binders. 



■ **Setup:** Manage Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders structure of each Binder Type. 

■ **Binders:** Access, work in, and manage binders. This is the default page when opening the module. 

**NOTES:** 

■ Binders Setup uses the “visibility” model for Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders in each Binder Type. This means that the Binder Types and the default Documentation Folders are visible to, and available to be used by, any squadron in the database. It also means that they can be modified by any Binder Administrator or Administrator in the database, as well as PEX Admin. 

■ Squadrons can modify the Documentation Folders structure within their own binders after creating them. 

26 

**Setup- Configure Binders **

**Setup tab **

In Setup you can add and delete Binder Types as wel as the default Documentation Folders structure in each Binder Type. 

**Binder Types **

To add, edit or delete Binder Types, either select the appropriate button at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select the option in the pop-up menu. 

**NOTES: **

■ Binder Types cannot be deleted if a squadron in the database is using the binder type. 

■ Due to the visibility model used in Binders Setup, the names and descriptions of Binder Types should clearly indicate what units/communities are to use the binder type and for what purpose\(s\). This is especially important for units in MAJCOM databases. This practice will minimize different units using the same binder type for different purposes and eventual y having conflicting standards in the structure. 

**Documentation Folders **

Documentation folders are tabs or sections within a binder. Here in Setup, you set the default folder structure for each binder type; thus, each binder created using a binder type is automatical y populated with the default folder structure for that binder type. Users have the capability to also retroactively insert the new folders to existing binders already using the Binder Type. This feature was added to make it easier to maintain a common folder structure for specific Binder Types. 

**Add a Documentation Folder to a Binder Type **

**1. ** Select the appropriate Binder Type in the drop-down at the top. 

**2. ** Either select Add at the top of the page or right-click in the grid and select Add in the popup menu. 

**3. ** Enter the Name and optionally the Description for the folder. 

**4. ** Click Save or Save & New to continue adding more folders. 

**5. ** Save 

■ If there are currently any binders in the database which use the selected Binder Type and you have Administrator or Binder Administrator to the squadrons using those binders, the Add New Folders to Binders dialog will open. Click in the check box for any existing binders to which you need to add the new folder. 

**NOTE:** Users wil only be able to see, and add the new folder to, binders in squadrons to which they have Administrator or Binder Administrator role. Other squadrons may be using the binder type, but their existing binders will not be affected. However, all binders created in the future using that binder type wil include the added documentation folder.

**Go/No-Go Basics **

**Introduction **

The mobile-friendly Go/No-Go board replaces the legacy Go/No-Go display. 

The PEX Go/No-Go module implements a positive control system. The module allows units to customize and display a Go/No-Go board with personnel status, personnel who are current and qualified to perform their missions and personnel who are not current and qualified. The module tracks medical status \(DNIF - Duty Not Including Flying\), read file signoffs \(FCIF - Flight Crew Information File\), training tasks \(TNG\), exams \(TEST\), Stan Eval \(S/E\) evaluations, Mission Ready Status, "Z" events \(FLY\) and flying hour maximums \(HRS\). In addition, units can add customized statuses to suit local needs. 

**Indicators **

**Basic **

The person has no issues or restrictions. 

The person has issues that may affect their ability to fly or perform required duties. 

The person has issues that prevent the person from flying or performing required duties. 

Status is not yet calculated for the person's qualification. 

**NA** Item not used by squadron.

**Module Notes **

■ The default column headers of DNIF and FCIF can be changed in their respective modules. 

■ Personnel with multiple MDSs and/or Crew Positions may \(depending on the filters used\) appear more than once on the Board. For example, a person with MDS qualifications of both B-2A and T-38A may be current on all B-2A training tasks but overdue on a T-38A tasks. That person would be green on the B-2A row and yel ow on the T-38A row.

The Aviation Service Code \(ASC\) is an Aviation Resource Management System \(ARMS\) term that defines the entitlement and flight status of an aircrew member. The code can be found on the crewmembers aeronautical orders \(AOs\). This code is a combination of two other codes, the crewmember’s Entitlement Status Code \(ESC\) plus the Flying Status Code \(FSC\). ASC = ESC \+ FSC. 

Certain ASCs mark the person No-Go. 

During the PEX import of ARMS training data, a Z-004 training task is generated by PEX, Z-004 HARM-ASC TERM DATE. Going beyond the ASC Termination Date will also mark the person as No-Go.

**Letter of X **

**Letter of X Basics **

**Introduction **

The Letter of X \(LoX\), also known as the Letter of Certifications, tracks certifications by person. 

Personnel can by organized into groupings by MDS, CP, etc. Certifications can be organized in unit-defined groups. LoX is database-wide using the visibility concept which allows certifications to be used by all units in the database, provided the certification is marked as visible to those units in the setup. The visibility concept makes it much easier to remove Certifications, Statuses, and Categories when not in use. 

**Permissions **

■ PEX Administrator and LoX Administrator: add, manage, assign, unassign certifications and create templates and custom views. 

46 

■ Draft Approver: if draft approver process is enabled, approve and disapprove certification changes. 

■ Basic User: View LoX using already created filters, custom views and templates. 

**Module Notes **

Certifications are tied to specific MDS\(s\) and Crew Position\(s\). 

**WARNING: **Changing a LoX item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has the certification “Syrian AOR Threat” and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. If you change the item to “Syrian Air Threat” it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. For more see Miscellaneous > Visibility Model. ** **

**Definitions **

**Qualification**. A qualification is the person’s reason for being in the squadron. It consists of an MDS 

and Crew Position. A person must have at least one primary qualification, but can have as many secondary qualifications as needed. A person’s qualification \(or Qual\) is established in Setup > Personnel > Quals Tab. 

**Certification**. A Certification is a basic capability that you want to assign to a select person or group of people for scheduling and/or tracking purposes. 

**Draft**. A change to a person’s certification. This only applies when the Squadron has chosen to 

“Enable Draft Process”. A change can be the first time a person is assigned the certification, a change to the person’s status, certification, decertification, recertification, and/or expiration dates, and any remarks associated to the certification. 

**Category**. Categories are optional. They are used to organize certifications. 

**Statuses**. The range of symbols you want to select from when assigning someone a certification \(i.e., X, I, T\). The status also includes a definition. The status and definition together makes the status unique, therefore, there can be a status of T – Training and T – In Training. 

**Assigned Mission Ready Status**. What the person is assigned in the Personnel module **Effective Mission Ready Status**. Status the person is currently performing at based on the requirements entered in the Continuation Training module 

**Is Certified**. Each status has an "Is Certified" option. When checked, anyone with this status wil be counted for the respective certification in the Long Range Schedule and will be eligible for display in the Mission Board, Schedule Supervisors dropdown. For example, a status of T \(for in training\) would have Is Certified unchecked so trainees do not count towards shift requirements, nor would the person appear in the supervisor schedule dropdown. 

**Visibility**. An indication of whether a certification can be seen/used by a given unit **LoX Template**. The template determines what certifications will be displayed and in what order. It will determine if selected dates will be displayed with the certifications. It contains signature block data and remarks. 

**Certification Date**. Optional field to indicate when an individual was certified. 

**Recertification Date**. Optional field to indicate when an individual is due for recertification \(notionally\). 

47 

!(images/000066.jpg)

Ops 

**Expiration Date**. Optional field that, when used \(and is a date that is in the past\) will cause the person to be Decertified \(for expiration\) in that certification. 

**Decertification Date**. Optional field that can be populated to indicate when a person was Decertified \(for cause\) in a given certification.

**Setup- Configuring the LoX **

**Preliminary Setup **

Before building a Letter of X, your squadrons must be established \(Setup > Squadrons\), and populated with personnel \(Setup > Personnel\). These personnel need to be assigned at least one qualification via the Personnel Module, Quals Tab. The key elements in a qualification are the MDS 

and Crew Position. 

**Setup **

**Categories **

**1. ** Go to Setup > Categories. 

**2. ** Click Add Category. 

**3. ** Enter the name, up to 25 characters, and save. Repeat as needed. For example, if you want to group your certifications under the headings Mission Qualifications and Non-Mission Qualifications, then create those two categories. 

**Status **

**4. ** Go to Setup > Status. 

**5. ** Click Add Status. 

49 

Ops 

**6. ** Enter the name, up to 5 characters. Enter a Description, up to 30 Characters. Uncheck the Is Certified Box only if you don’t want people assigned this status to count against mission requirements. Save. 

**7. ** Repeat for the range of statuses you plan to use. Common use cases would by **X** \(Qualified\), **I** \(Instructor\), **T** \(Training\). 

**CAUTION:** Consult someone with database-wide LoX Admin permissions \(or higher\) before deleting a status from the list of statuses \(LoX > Setup > Statuses\). Anyone in the database using that status will lose it, even if they are in a different unit to which you do not have permissions. 

**Certifications **

**8. ** Go to Setup > Certifications 

**9. ** Click Add Certification. 

**10. ** Check at least one MDS and Crew Position. 

**11. ** Check at least one status. 

**12. ** Check the optional category \(or categories\) you want to associate this certification with. 

**13. ** Check the units that will use this certification \(this is known as establishing visibility\) **14. ** Click Save 

**NOTE**: You will be unable to uncheck an MDS or CP setting once the certification is saved. You will still be able to check additional MDS and Crew Position combinations for that certification, but never uncheck. If an expected MDS or CP is not listed, make sure someone is assigned to that MDS and CP in Setup > Personnel Module > Quals Tab. 

**TTP:** Sometimes units carry certifications which are progressive and exclusive. These can be combined into a single certification with a unique status. For instance, 2-ship flight lead and 4-ship flight lead do not need to be tracked as separate certifications. The Certification could be Flight Lead and the status assigned could be 2F, 4F, and T. 

**Visibility **

Make certifications visible to, or remove visibility from, squadrons: 

**15. ** Check or uncheck the box in the row of the certification and column of the squadron to add or remove visibility. 

**16. ** Click the save icon. 

**NOTE**: You will not be able to add, edit, or delete a certification after you start modifying visibility until you click the save or undo icon. 

**Associate Training Tasks to Certification **

Associating certifications to training tasks will display the training task status \(yellow or pink\) from the continuation training module on the LoX display/report. Current training will not show any color coding on the LoX display/report. 

50 

**NOTE**: When a person assigned a certification that has been associated to a training tasks, if the person is not assigned the assigned the associated training task or goes overdue for completion, then the certification status will be “DT” or Decertified for Training.

**ORM **

**Setup ORM **

**Introduction **

The ORM \(Operational Risk Management\) module provides a tool for assessing the risk associated with conducting missions under different conditions. The module takes into consideration Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Crew Stress, and user-defined Risk Conditions. 

**Permissions **

■ To access and configure ORM > Setup tab: Administrator. 

■ To accomplish Risk Analysis: Basic User, OPS Desk, OPS Staff, SOF, or Flight Scheduler. 

■ To view the ORM module: Ground Scheduler or Flying Hours roles. 

**Rules **

■ If the takeoff time is in the past, you cannot make changes to Risk Conditions or Crew Stress, and the Sortie Risk Value is preserved. 

■ If more than one condition is selected within a category, PEX calculates the riskiest condition. 

**Module Notes **

■ The Sorties grid displays sorties as setup in Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Crew tab. 

■ Selecting a formation shows all formation crewmembers, even though each sortie is independently valued. 

■ The ORM module has no functionality for printing a report or for managing supervisor approval of missions. 

**Controls **

These procedures are accessed by navigating to Ops > ORM.

Ops 

**Setup Overview **

First setup other PEX modules for ORM. Then setup the ORM module itself by establishing Risk Categories, and within each Category, assign Risk Conditions and Values. Determine the Approval Authority Levels for accumulated Risk Levels. Assign Risk Weighting Settings. 

**Setup other PEX modules for ORM **

Before using ORM, you must customize the data in other PEX modules according to your personnel and mission. Go to: 

**1. ** Setup > Validation > Scheduling > Mission Board > Sortie Type Enter a Risk Value between 1 and 10 for each sortie type, 10 being the most risky sortie types. 

**2. ** Setup > Personnel 

**A. ** In each person's Pri Exp Risk column, enter a subjective risk between 1 and 10 for that person. Low experience equals higher risk. For example, an experienced person might have a value of 2, while an inexperienced person might have a value of 9. 

**B. ** In the Setup tab > Crew Position, enter a subjective Risk Weighting percentage between 1 and 100 for each crew positions. The sum of your weightings for all crew positions must equal 100. For example, if you have single-seat fighters, enter 100. If you have a multi-crew mission, enter the percentage that each crew position impacts ORM. For example, Pilot = 75 

and Copilot = 25. 

**Setup the ORM module **

Go to Ops > ORM > Setup tab. 

**3. ** **Risk Categories. ** Enter general categories of risk conditions. This list is completely unit-defined. Examples are Ceiling, Visibility, Icing, Precipitation, Crosswinds, and HQ Taskings. 

**A. ** Right-click and select the required categories from the Master List. 

**B. ** Add it if it is not contained in the Master List. 

**4. ** **Risk Conditions. ** The Risk Category column builds from the list of Risk Categories. 

**A. ** Right-click and add a row. 

**B. ** Select the required Category. 

**C. ** Enter a Risk Condition. 

**D. ** Enter a Risk Value. 

**E. ** Repeat as required other Risk Conditions and Values within each Category. 

For example; Icing.

**6. ** Risk Weighting Settings. 

**A. ** Risk Weightings. Set the four relative factors, Sortie Type, Personnel Experience, Pilot Stress, and Risk Conditions, to total 100. 

Your risk level totals need to be based on whether you use a risk graph display of raw or weighted as your total values are influenced by this option. 

For example, if you have a Sortie Type risk value of 5, and a Personnel Experience Risk of 6, Risk Conditions of 4, and Crew Stress of 4, the Raw total is 19. In weighted Example 1 below, if you weighted each of those risk values at 25%, your Sortie Type risk value would be 1.25, Personnel Experience Risk 1.5, Risk Conditions 1.0, and Crew Stress of 1.0. Your total weighted risk is now 4.75. If you have a risk level of 5 or above requiring Squadron DO 

approval, the example would be above that threshold if using raw risk levels but would be below the threshold for weighted risk levels. Weighted example 2 sets the values at 10, 30, 40, and 20 percent.

**Weapons Loads and SCLs **

69 

Ops 

The Weapons module is used to define Loads, MDS Stations, and SCLs \(Standard Configuration Loads\) for use in the flight scheduling module. The Weapons module can be used by transport-type squadrons to schedule cargo. 

**Visibility**. Use the Load Items Visibility and the SCLs Visibility pages to control which Load Items and SCLs show up in your squadron’s drop-down lists. 

**Load Item Types**. Load Item Types group similar load items. Examples of Load Item Types are Bombs, Pods, Chaff, and Flares. Right-click to Add, Delete, or Edit. 

**Build a Load Item **

Load Items represent the combination of different Components that produce a completed weapon. 

For example, a MK-84 Load Item is comprised of a MK-84 Tail Fin component, MK-84 Main Weapon component, and MK-84 Nose Fuse component. You do not need to identify all components. For simplicity, you can pick just the main component, but every Load Item needs at least a single component. 

Preparatory Steps \(This will reduce clutter as you build a new Load Item\): **1. ** Go to Munitions** > ** Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

**2. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > Components and de-select the checkboxes for Components not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

**3. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

Building Steps: 

**1. ** Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder and in the Load Item grid, right-click Add. 

**2. ** The Add Load Item dialog displays. At a minimum, select the Category, add a Code \(e.g., A or 46\), Name \(e.g., AIM-9X\), and select a Type. CRC, Weight, and Remarks can also be added but are not required. 

**3. ** Select from available components \(left grid\), by clicking and dragging it/them over to the Load Item Components Grid \(right grid\). When the desired component\(s\) is moved, select Save. 

**Edit a Load Item**. Go to Munitions > Load Item Builder. Right-click on the Load Item and select Edit. 

To remove a component from the Load Item, right-click on the component and select Remove. If your Load Item is in use, you cannot edit the Category or Components. If you need to edit those, rename the Load Item to Load Item\_old and re-build the correct Load Item from scratch. 

**Delete a Load Item**. Normal y, you do not need to delete a Load Item. If you don’t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > Load Items Visibility. If you truly want to delete the Load Item from your database, de-select visibility on the Load Item from al squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. 

**Identify MDS Stations **

**1. ** Create MDS configurations for assigned aircraft models. This is where you enter the stations on an MDS. Fighter examples are 1, 2, etc. Bomber examples are FWD Bomb Bay, AFT Bomb Bay. 

**2. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > MDS Stations 

**3. ** Select the desired MDS 

70 

**4. ** Right-click in the MDS Stations Grid and select Add **5. ** Name the Station. E.g., 1 or FWD Bomb Bay 

**6. ** In addition to listing every named MDS station, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares, if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. 

**7. ** To edit or delete a Station, right-click on it. To adjust the order, click and drag the Station. 

**Build an SCL **

SCLs represent the combination of different Load Items, by MDS, and by Station. For example, on a bomber MDS: 4 \(Quantity\) B-61 \(Load Item\) in the Forward Bomb Bay \(Station\) and 8 CBU-89 in the Aft Bomb Bay. This SCL could be called Standard Nuclear Load 1. A fighter example is: 1 AMRAAM on Station 1, 500 bundles of RR-112 Chaff on Station 3, and 1 AMRAAM on Station 5. This SCL could be called A5A. 

Quick and Easy Way – Use this method if all you need is a list of your SCLs to show up for scheduling and you don’t need any information in PEX about the SCL load items or which stations they are on. 

Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. In the Used By grid, select the MDS\(s\) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. 

Normal Way – Use this method if you want the schedulers to know the load items in an SCL and which stations they go on. 

Preparatory Steps \(These will reduce the clutter as you build a new SCL and make the building steps easier\): 

**1. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > Categories and de-select the checkbox for Migration for your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

**2. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > Load Item Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for Load Items not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

**3. ** Go to Munitions > Setup > SCLs Visibility and de-select the checkboxes for SCLs not used by your squadron. Click the floppy disk icon to save. 

Building Steps: 

**1. ** Go to Munitions > SCL Builder. Right-click in the SCL grid and select Add. 

**2. ** The Add SCL dialog displays for data input. At a minimum, select the MDS and name it within the SCL Details Grid. Description is not required, but is recommended. Example SCL names are SCL-01, A5A, Standard Conventional Load. An example SCL description is AIM-9X MAV MAV 

AIM-9X 500 Rounds. 

**3. ** In the Used By grid, select the MDS\(s\) for which the SCL is being developed. E.g., the SCLs used by the F-16C are also used by the F-16D. 

**4. ** Click and drag the desired load items from the Available Load Items list to the desired Station. 

**5. ** To increase the quantity of a load item assigned to a station, double-click the Qty field and edit the number. 

When the SCL is ready for use, select the Active checkbox and Save. 

71 

Ops 

**Edit an SCL**. Right-click on the SCL and select Edit. To remove a Load Item from a Station, right-click on the Load Item and select Delete Load Item. To add a Load Item to a Station, drag it over from the Available Load Items grid. When done editing, click Save. 

**Delete an SCL**. Normally, you do not need to delete an SCL. If you don’t want to see it anymore in drop-down lists, simply de-select visibility under your squadron at Setup > SCL Visibility. If you truly want to delete the SCL from your database, de-select visibility on the SCL from all squadrons and then right-click Edit and Delete. 

**Associate an SCL to a Sortie Type**. If a particular Sortie Type almost always uses the same SCL, PEX 

can default the SCL for you when you use the Mission Board. This does not work using the Flying Schedule Sortie Tab. Go to Setup > Validation > Mission Board > Sortie Type and pick a default SCL 

for your Sortie Types. 

**Use Automatic Load Codes \(formerly known as Auto SCL\) **

Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. 

The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overall requested loading for the sortie, which we in PEX call Load Code \(formerly Auto SCL\). For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM 

pod of code 41, and an ammo loading code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. If your unit schedules load items this way: 

**1. ** Use only a single station on the MDS/sortie. Call it whatever you like, “Sortie” would be fine. 

**2. ** Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. 

**3. ** PEX will generate a Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board, once a Tail Number is selected. 

**Weapons Training **

The Weapons Module is used to track weapons deployment and scoring for the unit. 

**1. ** **Setup**: Populate validation tables that support drop-down menus throughout the Weapons Module Training Menu from the Setup Page. 

**A. ** Assessment Types: Within the Weapons Module, “Assessment Types” represent the various means of assessing weapons deployment available to the crewmember. 

**1\)** Add Assessment Types by right-clicking within the Assessment Types Grid and selecting “Add.” Name the new Assessment Type \(required\).

**AFTO Form 781 **

**Introduction **

Use PEX to log AFTO 781 Mission Data and Aircrew Data. That data can then be audited within PEX 

and exported to the ARMS database. 

**Setup **

**1. ** In Training > Continuation > ARMs > Settings > ARMS Data > 781 Data: enter your unit’s HARM Code, 4-character Flying Organization Unit ID, 17-character Flying Organization Unit ID, and the Issuing Unit you want to appear on the AFTO 781. You can find this information on an existing 781. 

74 

**2. ** In Maintenance > Aircraft: enter the ARMS MDS and ARMS ID for each MDS and Tail Number. 

**3. ** Advise your flight schedulers they must enter the following information for each sortie: MDS, Tail \#, Takeoff Location, Land Location, MUC \(Mission Symbol\) and Flight Authorization \# 

**4. ** Advise your crew schedulers to put the aircraft commander at the top of the crew list. 

**Implement **

In the maintenance debrief office, setup a computer logged into PEX with the Squadron Daily Schedule \(SDS\) module in view. The SDS lists every sortie scheduled to fly that day. For each sortie, there is an “AFTO 781” link. When the crew gets back from flying, they would click on the 781 link for their sortie, fill out the Mission 

Data and Aircrew Data, and electronically sign off the pilot review. \(They can also fill out their TAR.\) The maintenance reviewer would then enter their initials and Save. 

There are two alternatives to this process but neither way includes a good way to get the maintenance review into PEX: 

■ Setup a computer near the Ops Desk for the crew to fill out their 781s and TARs. 

■ When a crewmember logs into PEX, on My Page, for every sortie, there is a 781 link, near the TAR link, which brings up the electronic 781. 

**Fil out the PEX AFTO 781 **

**1. ** Click on your sortie’s 781 link to launch the PEX AFTO 781 dialog. 

**2. ** If you flew on more than one sortie, in the same tail number, on the same day, PEX provides you the option to include those sorties on a single AFTO 781. 

**NOTE**: ARMS uses only the Mission Number of the first flight in the sequence. 

**3. ** Fill out the Mission and Aircrew Data. Anyone can fill out the 781. 

**NOTE**: You can use one of three different mission numbers. To pick, click Select next to Mission Number at the top of the 781 dialog. Choose either \(PEX\) Mission Number, AMC 

Mission Number, or Maintenance Line Number. This is a squadron-wide setting and will be retained for future 781s until changed again. 

**NOTE**: If the tail number \(or MDS\) changed at the last minute, you can click on the ARMS MDS 

or ARMS Serial \# Edit links at the top of the dialog and update. 

**4. ** The Aircraft Commander signs off the Pilot Review using their PEX PIN \(mandatory\). This readies the 781 for SARM audit and export to ARMS. 

**5. ** The Maintenance Debriefer types in their initials and signs off their review \(optional but recommended\). Print out the 781 and leave the hard copy with Maintenance. 

75 

**Scheduling **

**ATO - Import an Air Tasking Order **

**Introduction **

PEX reads an Air Tasking Order \(ATO\) in the USMTF 2000/2004 and NATO formats, saves the general ATO 

data, saves the mission data for your selected missions to help build your flying schedule, and permits you to update those missions based on an ATO change message. 

**Best Practice **

Existing PEX sorties cannot be linked to imported ATO sorties. If you build a flying schedule in PEX, in anticipation of an ATO, when you subsequently import the ATO into PEX, you wil end up with two sets of sorties: your anticipated sorties and your imported ATO sorties. You do not want this. What you want is a single set of sorties with your ATO data. To do that: 

**1. ** Build your anticipated ATO flying schedule outside of PEX, in Excel for example. This anticipated schedule would include: \# of Lines and Formations, MDS, Tail Number, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times. 

**2. ** Import the ATO into PEX. 

**3. ** Let PEX build the draft flying schedule based on the ATO. 

**4. ** Transfer the data from your anticipated schedule \(Tail \#, SCLs, Crew, Show, and Brief Times\) into the ATO-imported sorties in PEX. 

**Import an ATO into PEX **

In the ATO module, browse to the location of the ATO file. PEX reads the ATO and displays aircraft missions in the Mission Summary grid. Non-aircraft missions are not displayed, e.g., naval missile taskings \(a MTGTLOC data set with no accompanying MSNACFT data set\). The grid displays either all ATO missions or just the missions for the ATO units you have mapped to a PEX squadron, depending on your selection. By default, the ATO mission goes to the mapped squadron and is assigned to the default aircraft type \(MDS\) for that squadron, but these can be changed before importing. Select the missions you want to add to the PEX database. If required, update the squadrons and MDSs to which the missions wil be assigned in PEX 

and click Import/Update. After you import, PEX saves general ATO data and all the data tied to the missions you selected. Some of the imported mission data is not viewable in the PEX Mission Board but al data for a selected mission is available in the PEX database via web services. Data for missions not selected in the Mission Summary grid is not saved to the PEX database. 

**NOTE:** A mission is identified as having a target \(TGT\) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: GTGTLOC, MTGTLOC, or SHIPTGT. A mission is identified as having air refueling \(AR\) if it includes any of the following ATO data sets: ARINFO, 5REFUEL, or REFTSK. 

**Associate your PEX Squadron to an ATO Unit **

As a time-saver, once you know how your PEX squadron is identified in the ATO, link it so you don’t have to select it in the Mission Summary grid for every mission you want imported. To do this, click the Display Only Mapped Squadrons hyperlink and a grid will appear listing all the PEX squadrons and a place to type in the ATO designation for each. 

77 

Scheduling 

**PEX Missions **

ATO missions do not match one-for-one to PEX missions but they wil have the same mission number. An ATO mission may contain multiple MDSs. A PEX mission is created for each ATO mission MSNACFT data set. 

In other words, if the ATO mission contains a MSNACFT data set for F15E and another for B52H; PEX will create two missions, one for the F15E and another for the B52H. 

**PEX Sorties **

PEX will create sorties based on the number of aircraft in the MSNACFT data set and/or the number of legs in AIRMOVE taskings. PEX will apply its formation logic to multi-aircraft \(MSNACFT\) missions. 

**Takeoff and Land Locations **

PEX establishes these locations from the ATO AMSNDAT set DEPLOC and ARRLOC fields. If there are no values in those fields, then PEX uses the Mission Board user-defined default takeoff location. 

**CAUTION:** Your Database could have three instances of the same location, for example: PEX KDMA, ATO 

KDMA, and ACO KDMA. If you imported an ACO, then the locations have relatively complete definitions including Lat/Long coordinates. When the ATO import occurs, PEX will look to see if you have an ACO 

location that matches \(e.g., ACO KDMA\). If it finds it, then it uses that one on for the sortie. If it does not find it, it searches for an ATO location \(e.g., ATO KDMA\) and uses it. If it finds neither, it creates a new location of Source = ATO and uses that one. The issue for you is that PEX creates the ATO location KDMA, but it does not know its Lat/Long. Go to Setup > Locations and enter Lat/Longs for frequently used ATO 

locations. 

**Takeoff and Land Times **

ATOs do not normally specify takeoff or land times. PEX calculates an estimated takeoff and land time for each ATO sortie. For speed, PEX uses the Speed entered in the Aircraft Module for the sortie MDS. If no speed is entered, PEX uses 350 knots ground speed. To determine takeoff time, PEX uses the first controlled \(frozen\) sortie event time, for example, a 5REFUEL with an ARCT of 10:40 at location EXXON BLUE. If PEX 

finds the Lat/Long of EXXON BLUE \(from the ACO import\) and if PEX finds the Lat/Long of the takeoff location, then PEX calculates a reasonable time enroute. If that turns out to be 35 minutes, then PEX 

calculates an estimated takeoff time of 10:05. If any of the required Lat/Long information is missing, PEX 

defaults to one hour prior, or 09:40 in our example. To calculate an estimated land time, PEX uses the last control ed \(frozen\) sortie event time. 

**Controlled \(Frozen\) Times **

PEX creates Sortie Events with frozen times for the fol owing ATO data sets: AIRDROP \(airdrop mission data\) 

AMSNLOC \(location data for missions with no target\) 

ARINFO \(refueling data for the receiver\) 

ASACSDAT \(air control data\) \(no time\) 

ASUPTFOR \(data on missions being supported\) \(no time\) 

CONTROLA \(control data\) \(no time\) 

GTGTLOC \(target location and description\) 

78 

MTGTLOC \(missile target data\) 

PTRCPLOT \(reconnaissance mission location data\) \(no time\) 

RECCEDAT \(reconnaissance data\) 

REFTSK \(refueling data for the tanker\) 

SHIPTGT \(naval target data\) 

1MSNRTE \(data on an established flight route\) 

5REFUEL \(receiver refueling data for the tanker\) 

7CONTROL \(data on controlled assets\) 

**ATO Changes **

Handle an ATO update just like an original ATO: browse to the change ATO file, select your missions, and click Import/Update. Missions with a gray background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are already in PEX 

and wil be updated when you select Import/Update. Missions with a white background in the Squadron and Aircraft fields are new missions and will be added to PEX when you select Import/Update. The log file will provide a list of cancelled, added, and updated missions. 

**WARNING:** Before importing an ATO change, ensure the original ATO has been imported. Check the Log Files to verify which ATOs and updates have been imported. If you inadvertently import an older version of the ATO than the one already in PEX, all subsequent ATO changes must be re-imported to ensure you have the latest data. 

**CAUTION:** PEX pre-selects all the missions in the Mission Summary grid for updating and adding. Unless you have a good reason for not updating or adding a mission, do not un-check the box next to the mission before clicking Import/Update. 

**Missions. ** If an ATO mission is cancelled, it will be cancelled in PEX. If the ATO update adds a mission, it will display in the Mission Summary grid so that it can be selected and added to the PEX database. 

**Sorties**. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination matches one already in PEX, PEX 

updates the ATO data for the original mission. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has more aircraft than the original, an additional sortie\(s\) is added to PEX. If an ATO MSNACFT data set and MDS/Call Sign combination has fewer aircraft than the original, PEX cancels the extra sortie\(s\). 

**AIRMOVE**. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings differs in the update from the current number of AIRMOVE 

taskings, PEX cancels all of that mission's sorties and adds new sorties in their place. If the number of AIRMOVE taskings is the same, PEX updates the data for the sorties. 

**Sortie Events. ** The data from the first updated ATO data set that matches an ATO data set in the original ATO is used to update only the ATO fields for that data set. For example, if the original ATO mission included a GTGTLOC, then the first GTGTLOC data set in the change ATO for that mission is used to update the original. 

Data entered manually through PEX for that GTGTLOC sortie event remains unaffected. If an additional ATO 

data set is in the change ATO, it is added to the mission. Using the previous example, if the original ATO had only one GTGTLOC and the change ATO includes two for the same mission, the additional GTGTLOC is added as another sortie event in PEX. If the change ATO does not contain a data set that was included in the original ATO, the sortie event is deleted from PEX for that mission. 

**Troubleshooting – Not Al ATO Missions Show Up **

When you browse to an ATO file, PEX parses out the units so you can pick which ones to import. If you know PEX did not list all the ATO units, there is a parsing problem, most likely caused by an ATO format error. 

79 

Scheduling 

When PEX encounters an ATO format error, subsequent units do not show up in the PEX list. To troubleshoot a problematic ATO: 

**1. ** Save the original ATO and make five copies. 

**2. ** In the first ATO copy, delete an entire TASKCNTRY section \(including al its TASKUNITs\). Save the modified ATO and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it again. PEX will parse out the units. If all the correct units show up, the ATO format problem is somewhere in the TASKCNTRY section you deleted. If all the correct units still do not show up, the problem is in another TASKCNTRY section. Keep removing TASKCNTRY sections until the ATO parses ok and you wil have identified the problematic TASKCNTRY 

section. 

**3. ** In the second ATO copy, now that you’ve identified the problematic TASKCNTRY section, repeat the above removal procedures for TASKUNIT sections \(within the problematic TASKNTRY\) until you identify the problematic TASKUNIT. 

**4. ** In the third ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic TASKUNIT, repeat the above removal procedures for each AMSNDAT group \(including al sub-sets, such as MSNACFT, ARINFO, AMPN, GTGTLOC, etc.\) until you identify the problematic mission \(AMSNDAT group\). 

**5. ** In the fourth ATO copy, now that you've identified the problematic mission group, remove its subsets, one-by-one, until the ATO parses ok. Once you've identified the problematic sub-set \(AMPN for example\), compare its format to the USMTF approved format and you should find the problem, for example, one too many slashes. 

**6. ** In the fifth ATO copy, fix the error manually and use the PEX ATO module to browse to it. It should parse correctly and list all units. 

**Bids and Availability **

**Bids and Availability- Basics **

**Introduction **

Bids and Availability is a tool used to analyze personnel “wants” with scheduling “needs”. Unit schedulers open and close bidding periods by month, add or remove bids, accept or reject bids and re-prioritize bids. 

Unit personnel make their priorities known to schedulers through their My Page > Bids & Availability page. 

When a scheduler accepts or rejects bids the person's status is auto-updated. Use these pages in conjunction with the Mission Board, Flying Schedule, Long Range Schedule or Commitments Board on a two-monitor set-up. 

**NOTE:** Please check all AF/MAJCOM/NGB guidance for implementation. 

**Permissions **

■ Basic Users have full rights to their own “Bids & Availability” information from My Page. 

■ Ground and Flight Schedulers create / modify and active bids and availability times / dates. 

**Rules **

Bids and Availability \(B&A\) consists of three steps to function properly. 

■ Setup of B&A. 

80 

■ Schedulers use of B&A. 

■ Use of B&A from My Page. 

**Controls **

These procedures are accessed by navigating to Scheduling > Bids and Availability. 

**Workspace **



**Bids and Availability- Setup **

**Personnel Availability Type **

This defines the type of availability a person has \(e.g., AT\), within the B&A module. Ensure that you are in the correct squadron and go to Setup >Validation >Scheduling >Tools >Personnel Availability Types. 

**1. ** Right click in the Listings pane and select Add to select a Personnel Availability type from the he Master Grid pane. Select the Personnel Availability Type you would like to use for B&A. 

**2. ** To add a new Personnel Availability Category, right click in the Listings Pane and select View/Edit Master List. Right click Add and enter the Availability Type and Description. The Type is limited to a maximum two letter code \(e.g., AT\). Description \(e.g., Annual Training\). Click above or below the new line entered to save in the Master Grid pane. Click apply or okay to save and exit. Continue to add types as needed. 

**3. ** If you need to add the Personnel Availability Types to other squadrons that you may be responsible for. Click on the Listing pane >Send To. The squadrons wil be listed. Check al the squadrons that you need the information to be displayed. Click outside the Send To pane to save and close. 

**Personnel Commitment Type **

Personnel Commitment types assist the scheduler in identifying the “type of Commitment an individual is being scheduled for \(e.g., TDY, Leave\). Ensure that you are in the correct squadron and go to Setup 

>Validation >Scheduling >Tools >Personnel Commitment Type. 

**1. ** Right click in the Listings pane and select Add. Select the Personnel Commitments Types you would like to use. Click Apply or OK. 

**2. ** To add a new Personnel Commitment type category, right click in the Listings Pane and select View/Edit Master List. Right click Add and enter the Enter the Personnel Commitment Type and choose the desired identifying color. Click off the line to save. Continue to add more types as needed. Once complete select OK. 

**3. ** If you need to add the Personnel Commitment Types to other squadrons that you may be responsible for. Click on the Listing pane >Send To. The squadrons will be listed. Check all the squadrons that you need the information to be displayed. Click outside the Send To pane to save and close. 

**4. ** Once the type has been added, under the Conflicts with Shift column, check the boxes as applicable if you want this commitment to identify when a conflict occurs. 

**Squadrons Availability **

81 

Scheduling 

Squadron Availability will establish a squadron’s availability periods. Availability periods are broken down into manageable periods in which your unit operates. For example, 4 periods of 6 hours each \(00:00-06:00, 06:00-12:00, etc\) or 2 periods of 12 hours each \(06:00-18:00, 18:00-06:00\). To setup the Squadron Availability go to Setup >Squadrons. 

**NOTE:** Only PEX Administrators can add Availability Periods you your squadron. 

**For PEX Administrators:** Select the unit. This wil activate the Availability Periods pane located at the bottom of your display. Right click in the pane and select Add to open the Add Availability Periods pop up. Select the number of “Availability Periods” to set from the Number drop. Up to six periods can be selected. Set the Start and End times for each period. Click OK to save. 

**NOTE:** A WARNING notice wil appear. Once you add the availability periods it cannot be edited or deleted. 

Periods can only be changed by adding a new availability period record. If you are sure the information is correct. Select OK in the warning notice to active the periods. Once activated, the availability periods created will appear within the grid. The first number represents the number of “total” periods for your squadron. 

Next to the period number are the actual time periods that were entered. 

**Personnel Availability **

Personnel Availability will allow personnel to be available for squadron available periods. To set the Personnel Availability for an individual, go to Setup >Personnel >Personnel Tab. Scroll to the right until you find the header/column labeled: “Avail Enabled?”. It is located approximately half way across the Personnel Pane. Check the box for each person that will be using Bids and Availability. This action will activate a person’s ability to use the bids and availability functions to indicate the period that they are available. Click off the individual to save the information. 

**Bids and Availability for Schedulers **

**Two-monitor Setup **

The scheduler can have a two-monitor setup. The intention of the two-monitor setup al ows the scheduler to have the B&A module displayed alongside another scheduling module such as Commitments Board, Flying schedule or Long Range schedule and others. Go to Scheduling>Bids and Availability. 

Place cursor in the top right center of the display and click on “Open in new window,” next to the Cog setup wheel. Double Click. This will activate a separate window for B&A. This action allows you to move the B&A module display to another monitor so you can view B&A and another scheduling module simultaneously. 

**Scheduler Opens/Close Bids **

The Scheduler uses the crew panel, calendar, details for people and bids for commitment areas to open and close bids. This location is customized. It wil also instruct you on how to open and close bids for your unit. 

A squadron scheduler wil open a bid for a commitment, to give personnel the opportunity to apply/be selected for a particular event \(e.g., NCO leadership school or ADLS Training\) NOTE: In order for B&A to work correctly there must be other scheduling modules in use. For example, there must be a Commitment created in Commitments Board in order for a Scheduler to open up a bid on a group commitment \(i.e. a training group commitment for ALS training, or TDY to Hawaii\). 

**A. ** **Crew Panel. ** The scheduler uses the Crew Panel to display personnel and when an individual is selected, to activate data within the other grids \(calendar, details for people and Bids for commitments\). Select a filter \(either use the funnel or use the drop down next to the funnel to select 82 

a filter\). Names will populate in crew panel. Select a name, some or all. Use shift/control keys to select multiple names. Once a name\(s\) is/are selected, their “details for People” information will appear to see their availability, commitments, or currency \(number 3 in the above graphic\). If a commitment has been created within the commitments board it will appear in the Calendar grid \(number 2 in the above graphic\). 

**B. ** **Calendar. ** The Calendar Grid displays Commitments for the selected squadron. The information that is display is customizable by selecting the Settings \(the gear wheel in the upper right portion of the screen; near refresh button\) and select the data to be displayed. Click Okay to save and exit. 

**C. ** **To open a bid**, place your cursor within the Calendar grid area and use the left/right arrows \(below the Squadron name\) to move the calendar right or left one month at a time to the selected 

“bidding” month you desire \(i.e., Feb, and/or June\). You can also use the smal calendar icon next to the arrows and select the month. Once a bidding month is selected, place your cursor on the “red” 

rectangle labeled “Closed” next to the words Bid Period, and slide the Closed to “Open.” This will al ow individuals within the squadron to bid on any commitments during that month they are available for. They will see these “open bid” commitments within their My Data, Bids and Availability section. 

**D. ** **Display Data By:** As a scheduler use the “display data by” drop down menu \(above the calendar/next to the squadron\) to look at the fol owing display options once you have opened up bidding in a particular month 

**1\)** **Availability**: Shows Shortnames next to the commitment if this commitment fits their period of availability \(if the individual entered their personnel availability within their MyData B&A\). This information can assist the scheduler in determining who might be present/available when he/she is trying to schedule personnel for a specific training slot/event. 

**2\)** **Bids**: Will display commitments. When you click on a particular commitment it will show names in green color if they have been scheduled for this commitment. 

**a\)** If they bid on this commitment you will see a red circle with a minus sign next to their name in the crew panel. And if you click on their name in the crew panel, you will see their bid priority number within the “Details for People” grid. 

**3\)** **Commitments**: Displays the commitment data \(Commitment Name, start/end time and remarks\) only 

**E. ** To Close the bids. Place your cursor within the Calendar grid area and use the left/right arrows \(below the Squadron name\) to move the calendar right or left one month at a time to the selected 

“bidding” month you desire \(i.e., Feb, and/or June\). You can use the smal calendar icon next to the arrows and select the month. Once a month is selected, place your cursor on the “green” rectangle labeled “open” next to the words Bid Period, and slide the open to “closed.” This wil close bidding for this month. 

**Accepting/Rejecting Bids **

Display data by “Bids” from the drop-down menu. Place the cursor on a commitment to see who has placed a bid for that commitment. If an individual or individuals bid on a commitment you will see a red circle with a minus sign next to their name in the crew pane. If their name is highlighted in green that means they are already scheduled for that commitment using the Commitment Board Module. Place the cursor on the Submitted drop down menu within the Bids for Commitment grid \(bottom right\). 



83 

Scheduling 

Select from the options to either Accept or Reject that persons bid. Continue this action as necessary. Select **Save Changes** button. This action al ows the individual to see in their B&A that they were accepted or rejected. 

**NOTE:** As a scheduler, when you Accept/Reject a bid you’re communicating with the person who entered a bid. Accepting/Rejecting does NOT schedule the person on that commitment. You must go into the Commitments Board module and actual y schedule the people for whom you have “Accepted” their bid. 

**Adding notes to Bids **

Schedulers can leave a note for an individual concerning the acceptance or rejection of a Bid. Start by placing the cursor within the Bids for Commitment grid. Place/hover your cursor to the left side of the Short Name. 

The word “remarks” will appear, click on it. The Bid Remarks dialog box will appear. Add your remarks are required. The remarks can contain a MAX of 255 characters Click Ok when completed. 

**Add a Bid **

Al ows a scheduler to add an individual to an existing commitment once bids are placed by squadron personnel. Place your cursor within the Calendar, ensure Bids is showing within the drop-down menu next to SQ name. 



Click on a commitment to see the proposed bids submitted by individuals \(bids for Commitment area; right side of display\). Within the Crew panel, select a name of an individual you want to add a bid for. Under Details for People their name will appear. If they have other bids they will appear. You should review these before adding a bid to ensure you will not “add” a bid for a commitment they can’t take. Hover cursor over the green \+ circle and the “add” bid option wil display. Click on the plus sign to add the bid. This action wil activate the Details for People grid \(Bids dropdown must show\), showing the person you selected, the priority of the bid, the commitment name, date, start/end time and type of commitment. It will also activate the Bids for Commitment grid. The individuals ShortName, and status wil now show that a bid was submitted. 



**Remove a Bid **

Allows a scheduler to remove an individual from an existing commitment once bids are placed by squadron personnel.

**Commitments Board **

**Commitments Board- Basics **

**Introduction **

The Commitments Board \(CB\) module al ows you to build a schedule of non-flying activities. These activities are cal ed commitments because resources which need to be scheduled can be both people and equipment, therefore this module provides the flexibility to commit either one or both of these types of resources. It is a multi-faceted module al owing a unit scheduler to tie multiple commitments together into Events, create specific crew templates to match desired qualifications and crew positions, or to use the product functionality of the module to generate a mission planning sheet \(MPS\) or output a date range of commitments to an excel spreadsheet. 

**Permissions **

Three permission roles can access Commitment Board, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: Operations Desk, Flying Schedule or Ground Scheduling permissions allow for access to work within the Commitment Board module. 

Basis User permissions are required to create a personal commitment form an individual’s MyPage. 

Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. 

**Rules **

Using the Events function, a scheduler can place an equipment commitment and a person commitment together within the CB module. However the equipment commitment portion wil not show up on the individuals MyPage. Only Personnel Commitments show on an individual’s MyPage. 

**Module Notes **

There are two different selections to make on the PEX Main Menu depending if you are in WinPEX or ePEX. 

For WinPEX, navigate to Scheduling > Commitments Board Web 

For ePEX, navigate to Scheduling > Commitments Board

**Mission Planning Sheet **

The Mission Planning Sheet \(MPS\) is designed for the Distributed Ground Control Station \(DCGS\) community. 

It resides in the Commitments Board and is designed to assist scheduling coordination. Commitment and 94 

personnel data automatically populate and additional remarks can be added. The MPS editor includes date/time stamped approval options. The MPS editor includes Letter of X warning flags when scheduled individuals are overdue, decertified, and/or expired for certifications. 

**Setup the Mission Planning Sheet \(MPS\) **

Go to Setup> Personnel> Setup> Office Symbol 

Right-click Add. Right-click Add again \(enter directly in the master list, not the unit’s list\). 

Enter “\[Unit\]/CC” for the office symbol, with \[unit\] being the name of the unit in the PEX database. For example, if the name of the unit in the PEX database is 80 FS, then the office symbol needs to be entered as 

“80 FS/CC”. In the Personnel Tab, assign that office symbol to the unit commander. Only one person in the unit should have this office symbol, otherwise, it may not return the correct person. Regardless, this field in the MPS can be overwritten and/or manually entered. 

**How to Use the Mission Planning Sheet **

In the Commitments Board, build a commitment using a Crew Template. Add personnel to fill the template positions. 

**NOTE: **When building a crew template, a role can be required or optional. These people are listed in the MPS Editor as “Personnel with Roles”. Those in required roles are indicated as critical, while those in an optional role are not. ** **

**NOTES: **

■ You can schedule additional people on that same commitment who do not go against any of the template roles. On the MPS, they are listed under “Personnel Without Roles.” You have the option to check any of these people as Critical. 

■ Select the commitment, right-click, and select “MPS …” to open the MPS Editor. Fill in the fields. 

■ Many of the fields al ow you to enter more text than that can possibly fit on the printed product. The extra text wil be truncated on the form. 

■ Save the MPS or Save & Print the MPS. 

■ Only someone with one of the following permission roles can make save or approve actions in the MPS 

editor: Administrator, Ops Desk, Flight Scheduling, or Ground scheduling. 

■ After the initial save, when the commitment is approved, select DO Approve & Save. 

■ DO Un-approve & Save removes approval date time stamp, and saves any modifications and updates the last saved date/time stamp. 

■ DO Re-Approve & Save, activated after an Un-approve action, adds Last Approved date/time stamp and saves any modifications and updates the last saved date/time stamp. 

**Legend **

■ PED/POS: A person’s qualifications from Setup> Personnel> Quals tab. 

■ Red X: Anyone who has at least one certification that is Decertified for Cause, Decertified for Expiration, or, has an overdue training task associated to a certification.

**AF Model Forecast **

This tab is used to calculate the number of hours required to accomplish training and operational requirements. Using this tab is optional. If you already know how many hours you are going to ask for or how many hours you are going to get, you should skip this section. 

**1. ** Select the AF Model Forecast tab. 

**2. ** At the bottom of the page, select New Account. Select the Period, BA, MDS, and PEC for the account you want to forecast. PEX will default an account name for you. If you prefer a different name enter it. 

Enter a version name, e.g., A, 1, or With CSAR. Click Save. 

**3. ** In the Force Structure grid, enter the number of your Primary Authorized Aircraft \(PAA\) and Crew Ratio by quarter. If you enter the value for the first quarter and then click off the line, PEX will helpfully copy that value to the remaining quarters. You can change them individually if necessary. Using these values, PEX will calculate the number of API-1 crews your unit is authorized. 

**4. ** In the Calculations grid, right-click on the Force Support line and select Edit. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, in the \# Events field, enter the number of Force Support sorties you expect and in the Event Dur field, enter the average sortie duration of those Force Support sorties. 

98 

**A. ** **CAF Model**. In the Calculations grid, right-click in the grid and select Add. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, select the Standard button. Select the API, Training Level, and Experience Level of one type of crewmember, e.g., 1, CMR, Experienced. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in \# Crew, the Event that drives their requirement \(e.g., RAP Sortie\), the number of those events they are required in \# Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember that drives requirements. 

**B. ** **MAF Model**. In the Calculations grid, right-click in the grid and select Add. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, select the Additional button. Enter one type of crewmember, e.g., AC 

Experienced. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in \# Crew, the Event that drives their requirement \(e.g., Initial Takeoff\), the number of those events they are required in \# 

Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember/event combination that drives requirements. 

**5. ** For additional crew requirements \(e.g., CSAR Exp Sorties, In-Unit AC Upgrades\), in the Calculations grid, right-click in the grid and select Add. In the Edit Crew Requirements dialog, select the Additional button. Enter one type of crewmember, e.g., CSAR Exp. For that type of crewmember, enter how many you have in \# Crew, the Event that drives their requirement \(e.g., CSAR Sortie\), the number of those events they are required in \# Events, and the average duration of that event in Event Dur. Click OK. 

Repeat this step for every different type of crewmember/event combination. 

**6. ** In the Summary grid, PEX calculates the number of sorties and hours required for this account based on the values you entered. These hours would be your requested Al ocated hours. 

**Flying Hours, Quick Setup **

These instructions will get your Flying Hour Plan \(FHP\) setup quickly to allow you time later on to become more familiar with other advanced features not addressed here. For many units, this quick setup may be enough, even long-term. 

**1. ** Go to PEX Scheduling > Flying Hours module > Flying Hours tab. In the Flying Hours Account grid, right-click and select Add. In the Flying Hours Account dialog, select the MDS\(s\) for the account, enter the Allocated Hours, Start Date \(usually 1 October\), End Date \(usually 30 Sep\), Version = 1, and give the Account a name \(e.g., FY15 F-16 O&M\). Click Save. 

**NOTE**: Enter the actual start date of the flying account, even if you are already in the midst of execution. PEX will allow you later on to tell it what’s already happened, using the Override Data command. 

**2. ** Notice the new account shows up in the grid. Click on it to select it. Notice in the bottom Attrition/ASD grid that the Total Hours have been spread out evenly across the months. Click on any of the Hours cells and a Total Allocated Hours dialog comes up. Change the monthly hours to match your contracted hours with Maintenance for each month, ensuring they stil add up to the Total. When done, click Save. 

**3. ** A dialog will read: “You should now go to the Weekly or Monthly view…” Ignore this dialog for the moment and click OK. Back in the Attrition/ASD grid, enter your expected Attrition and ASD for each month. 

**4. ** Just before the flight schedulers start building missions that wil be charged to this FHP, have them go to Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings > Add Sortie > and set the default FHP to what you just created. This way, when they add missions, the default FHP will already be set. 

**5. ** Stress to the flight schedulers that every sortie in PEX should have an FHP selected. 

99 

Scheduling 

**6. ** Stress to the Ops Desk that every sortie’s FHP should be double-checked after it flies. 

**7. ** As crews come back from flying and they fill out their PEX AFTO 781, the sortie flying time will automatical y feed this Flying Hours module. If you don’t yet use PEX AFTO 781s, then make sure the Actual Takeoff and Land Times are entered in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule modules **8. ** Use the Flying Hours > Overview tab > Filter icon \(top right\) to select a particular FHP of interest. 

Use the Flying Hours > Daily and Graphs pages to monitor FHP execution. 

**Flying Hours, Advanced **

First, follow the instructions from the Flying Hours, Quick Setup topic to identify and setup your flying hour accounts. Use these advanced instructions to specify no-fly and surge days. By doing so, PEX will calculate how many sorties and hours you should fly daily to properly execute your flying plan. You can then plan your daily flying in detail by identifying flying periods, times, sortie types, and/or number of sorties. Use the Weekly page for all your work as it displays extra data you will need; use the Monthly page for the bigger picture. 

**1. ** **Pick the Plan**. Go to Flying Hours > Weekly page. Select the Flying Hours Settings icon \(looks like a funnel\) at top-right. Filter down to the single flying plan you are interested in. Starting from the left, select the desired Wing, Group, Squadron, Period, Budget Activity, MDS, PEC, a single Account and a Version is necessary. 

**2. ** **Establish the Override Date** \(if required\). If you are already in the midst of a flying plan year, tel PEX what has already been flown on that account. On the Weekly page, right-click on any day and select Override Data. Select the month through which you wish to override data. Enter the flying data \(Forecast, Planned, Scheduled, and Actual Sorties and Hours\) through the end of that month in the plan. 

PEX uses these values as historical data. Overrides cannot be done by day, only by month. Click Save to save the override data. Click Cancel to exit the dialog without saving any changes. When the next dialog appears, redistribute the remaining monthly hours as desired. Each overridden day will display Data Overridden on the Weekly and Monthly views. You can delete an Override from the Flying Hours Override dialog by clicking on the Delete button. After overriding data, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. 

**3. ** **Establish the No-Fly Dates**. Tell PEX the dates you don’t plan to fly so it wil take those dates out of the calculation. Right-click on any day and select No Fly Days. Select your no fly days and click Save. At the top of the grid are some choices which help you select multiple days easily. For instance, if you choose Sunday then all Sundays will be marked as no-fly. You could then click on any individual Sunday to set it back to a fly day. Or you could choose Federal Holidays and all Federal Holidays will be marked as no-fly. Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. 

**NOTE**: When required, No-Fly Days can quickly be set back to Fly Days \(and vice-versa\) by right- clicking on the day \(in the Weekly view\) and selecting the Set as No Fly Day or Set as Fly Day. When you do, notice your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. 

**4. ** **Establish your Surge or Minimum Fly \(Locked\) Dates**. Tell PEX the dates you want to fly more or less than usual so it can use the information when calculating the required sorties/hours \(Calc\). Right-click on the desired date and select Change Sorties/Hours. Enter the number of sorties and hours you expect to schedule that day. After the values are entered, a lock will appear on that day. Later, when you re-calculate, PEX will use these manually entered values minus attrition for what you can expect to accomplish for that date. \(This is how you tell PEX what you are going to schedule for a given day, instead of PEX recommending what you should schedule.\) Notice that your Calc numbers are red indicating they are no longer valid. 

100 

**5. ** **Calculate the Plan**. On the Weekly page, when the Calc numbers are red, this indicates the numbers are not valid and they need to be re-calculated for the changes you have made. To re-calculate your sorties/hours, first decide on a date from which to reflow the Calculated Hours. 

**A. ** If your Flying Plan start date is in the future, you would choose the start date. 

**B. ** If your start date is already in the past, you would normal y choose a date in the future \(possibly/probably the first of next month\), thereby leaving the already agreed upon sorties/hours the same up until the date you select. 

**NOTE**: On your selected date, right-click and select Calculate Plan. PEX will then calculate how many sorties/hours you should plan on a given day, taking into account your monthly contract hours, ASD, attrition, and Locked days. Notice that the Calc numbers are no longer red but are now black, indicating they are valid numbers with which to make scheduling decisions. 

PEX uses the following logic to calculate the sorties/hours on a given date: **C. ** PEX takes the monthly Contract hours and increases them to account for the attrition factor. 

E.g., 1000 monthly Contract hours and 15% attrition. The 1000 hours is increased to 1176.47, so when you lose 15% \(176.47\), you end up with the 1000 desired hours. 

**D. ** \(Current Month Only\) PEX then subtracts the actual hours you have already flown this month from the remaining hours. E.g., 1176.47 minus 100 actual hours equals 1076.47 left to fly this month. 

**E. ** PEX then calculates that you want zero hours on No-Fly Days. 

**F. ** PEX then uses the number of hours entered through the Change Sorties/Hours dialog on Changed \(Locked\) Days and lessens the amount by the monthly expected attrition. 

**G. ** PEX then divides the remaining hours \(e.g., 1076.47\) by the monthly ASD to determine the number of sorties that should be flown that month. E.g., 1076.47 hours and ASD of 1.5 equals 717.6 

sorties. 

**H. ** PEX then distributes the remaining sorties equally among the remaining flying days in the month. 

It then multiplies the sorties by the monthly ASD to determine how many hours should be flown each day. 

**6. ** **Plan Sorties/Hours in Detail**. Now that PEX has calculated how many sorties/hours you should plan on any given day in your flying plan, you can specify in more detail how those sorties will be scheduled. 

Planning the sorties/hours to this level of detail is optional but many units find it helpful for coordination with Maintenance and outside organizations. To plan sorties/hours in detail, right-click on the desired date and select Plan Sorties. In the Planned Sorties dialog, right-click in the grid and select Add. Select a Flying Period from the list and enter a Start Time and End Time for that Flying Period. Select the Sortie Type and enter the Count. Modify the ASD, if required. Repeat, adding Flying Periods and Sorties until the Plan numbers equal \(or approximate\) the Calc numbers. 

**TTP**: Once you have a date completely planned, you can copy it to other dates by right-clicking on the date and selecting Copy Day. Then, select the days and/or dates you want to copy to and select Paste. 

**7. ** **Update Total Al ocated Hours**. To add or subtract Total Allocated Hours while executing the Flying Hour Plan, in the Overview page left-click in the bottom row labeled Hours. A new dialog opens and Total Allocated Hours may be overwritten. Clicking off the line re-calculates the monthly Contract hours in that dialog. Clicking Save prompts you to re-calculate the Plan in the Calendar. 

**8. ** **Copy Accounts**. If you have multiple accounts to manage that are very similar in terms of no-fly days, ASDs, attrition, etc., instead of starting from scratch, you can copy an existing account and then make modifications to the new account. Once copied, the only things not modifiable are the account Start 101 

Scheduling 

Date, End Date, Local/Zulu, and Location. To copy an account, select Flying Hours Tab, Overview page. 

Select the account, right-click and select Copy Account. Modify the Squadron, Period, BA, PEC, Name \(mandatory\), Version \(mandatory\), and MDS as desired. Click Save. Total hours can be modified by clicking on the Hours row in the Attrition/ASD gird after the account is copied. 

**9. ** **New Version of an Account**. Using versions allows you to develop what if.. scenarios. For example, you might need to calculate the number of sorties required with different monthly ASDs. To make another version of an account, right-click on an account and select Create New Version. In the dialog, enter a designation \(e.g., B or C\) for this version. PEX will copy everything about the original account into the new version. From there, you can modify attrition, ASDs, budgeted hours, and/or planned sorties/hours. Only one version of an account is active at any time. Inactivating all versions of an account inactivates the overal account. When you are done tracking an account, inactivate it so it doesnt show on lists anymore. 

**A. ** **To Set a Version to Active**. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the account to be set to active under the accounts header. When the ‘Monthly’ view appears check the ‘Active Version’ 

checkbox in the upper left corner. 

**B. ** **To Set a Version to Inactive**. Go to Flying Hours tab > Overview click on the active account \(shown in green\) to be set to inactive under the accounts header. When the ‘Monthly’ view appears uncheck the ‘Active Version’ checkbox in the upper left corner. 

**C. ** **Delete a Version**. From the ‘Flying Hours’ tab right click and select the ‘Delete’ button. This wil not delete the overal account, only that version of it. 

**D. ** **View an Inactivated Account**. From the ‘Flying Hours’ tab click on the funnel icon at the upper right corner of the display and checkmark ‘Show Inactive Accounts’ and continue the selection process as normal. 

**E. ** **Delete an Account**. To completely delete an account al flying hour versions created for the account to be must be deleted. 

**NOTE**: Once sorties have been created and logged against a particular flying hour account and version it is impossible to delete it. 

**10. ** **Single and Multi-Day Remarks**. If desired, Single-Day Remark and Multi-Day Remarks can be set by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate command. These functions wil not work on dates in the past. Multi-Day Remarks are displayed on the Weekly view but not the Monthly. 

**11. ** **Background Colors**. If desired, to highlight a particular day\(s\), right-click and select Background Color. This function wil not work on dates in the past. 

**12. ** **Starting Calendar Day**. You can tell PEX what day of the week you want the weekly view to start on. 

For instance, if you want this view to display Monday as the first day of information, right-click on a Monday and select Starting Calendar Day. 

**Flying Hours, Associate Units **

If your flying organization is an association of Active Duty \(AD\), National Guard \(ANG\), and/or Reserve \(AFRC\) units, this topic details how to setup the PEX Flying Hours module. Let’s say the AD wing develops the overal flying plan for the base. They decide which days to fly and how many sorties to fly each day. After the sorties are flown, depending on whether the pilot and/or aircraft belonged to AD, ANG, or AFRC; the flying hours get charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC. If this is your situation, you need to setup an account for each MAJCOM 

\(AD, ANG, and AFRC\) plus an overal base \(e.g., Langley AFB\) account for them to feed into: 102 

**1. ** On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for the overall base \(AD \+ ANG \+ AFRC\). 

In this account, identify the Total \(Al ocated\) Hours for AD \+ ANG \+ AFRC. In this base account, identify the overal Expected Attrition, ASD, and monthly contract hours \(AD \+ ANG \+ AFRC\). 

**2. ** On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AD sorties. In this account, identify the Total \(Al ocated\) Hours for AD only. In this AD account, identify the monthly breakout of AD 

hours. \(These are the flying hours that will feed ACC’s Flying Hours Online \(FHOL\) application.\) Adding more detail \(Att% or ASD\) to this account is optional. 

**3. ** On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the ANG sorties. In this account, identify the Total \(Allocated\) Hours for ANG only. Adding more detail \(monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD\) to this account is optional. 

**4. ** On the Overview page, create a PEX Flying Hours account for only the AFRC sorties. In this account, identify the Total \(Allocated\) Hours for AFRC only. Adding more detail \(monthly breakout of hours, Att%, or ASD\) to this account is optional. 

**5. ** On the Overview page, right-click on the AD account and select “Edit.” In the “Also Update” list, select the overall base account created in Step 1. This will feed scheduled/actual sorties/hours from the AD account to the overall base account. 

**6. ** Repeat Step 7 using the ANG and AFRC accounts. Have those accounts “Also Update” the overal base account created in Step 1. 

**7. ** In the PEX Mission Board > Tools > Pre-Mission Settings, Set the default Flying Plan to the overal base account created in Step 1. This will default all new sorties to the base flying hours account. 

**8. ** After sorties are flown, decide whether they are to be charged to AD, ANG, or AFRC and select the appropriate account in the Mission Board, Sorties grid, Flying Plan column. 

**9. ** Use the overall base account to monitor the overall progress of the geographic location and the associated accounts to monitor AD, ANG, or AFRC individually. 

**Flying Hours, Monitor Execution **

First, pick the Flying Hours Account\(s\) you are interested in. On the Flying Hours tab > Overview page, click the Flying Hours Settings icon \(funnel\) at the top-right of the page. Make your selections and narrow down the list of Accounts to just the one\(s\) you are interested in. 

**Overview Page **

■ View Target Hours for the current date 

■ View Actual Hours flown to date 

■ View Hours Remaining to date 

■ View a Progress bar comparing Target Hours to Actual Hours 

**Daily Page \(Single Account Only\) **

This page provides a detailed listing of hours and sortie data about a single account. It includes every day in the plan and a running sum of each category. Right-click to export the data to Excel. The day is displayed in either Zulu or Local, depending on your selections when the flying hours account was created. To determine whether your day is displayed in Zulu or Local, return to the overview page, right-click on the account, select Edit and look at the bottom left corner of the Edit dialog.

**Graphs Page **

New Graphs page functionality includes: 

■ Opening the page in a new, separate window. 

■ Colors matched to MAJCOM Flying Hour Program standards. 

■ The ability to export the graph as a PDF or image file, image option formats being PNG or SVG. While both PNG and SVG support transparency \(the ability to view background through the image\), SVG can be scaled to any size. 

Five different graphs provide data about the flying plan Sorties, Hours \(\), Attrition, Average Sortie Duration, and Hours \(\). 

Attrition. The Attrition graph displays sortie \(not hours\) attrition. 

Hours \(Line, not Bars\). The Contract line on the Hours line graph resets to the Flown value at the end of each month. In other words, if you contracted for 350 hours for the month of October but flew 400, the October contract line would end at 350 but the November contract line would start at 400 hours. The Future Scheduled line on the Hours line graph takes attrition into account. In other words, the display assumes you will lose the specified percentage of the schedule. To attain your flying hour goal, you should schedule enough sorties so the Future Scheduled line ends at the same point as the Contract line. 

**View Summary Data **

To view a monthly or weekly summary of the progress of your flying plan, go to either the Monthly or Weekly pages and click on the Summary link at the top right of the page. This will open the Summary dialog with data for the month of the date you had selected on the Monthly or Weekly page. The top half of the dialog breaks the month up by week. For each week, and for both Sorties and Hours, PEX displays the Contract, Plan, Sched, Actual and Delta hours for that week \(or partial week.\) The bottom half of the dialog has three date spans: 

■ The Plan through the end of last month 

■ The Plan for just this month 

■ The Plan through the end of this month. 

Each date span includes the same data as the top half of the page as well as showing Plan vs Actual for Att Rate, ASD, and Fly Days. 

**Day-to-Day Use **

When you get so far ahead or behind on flying hours that you need to re-plan: create another version of the account. Do not create a new Account. In that new version, change your planning factors \(Allocated Hours, ASD, attrition, no-fly days, surge days, etc.\). Then select a date from which to reflow the hours, and recalculate the plan. If you then decide to implement the modified plan, select it as the "Active Version" on the Weekly view. By creating another version, you retain your original plan in case you need to reference it later. 

**REMIS- Reconcile your hours **

**Reconciliation, Identify Discrepancies **

The Reconciliation page shows you your PEX and REMIS sorties so you can match these sorties and identify discrepancies between PEX and REMIS. To reconcile: 

**1. ** Navigate to Scheduling > Flying Hours > REMIS > Reconciliation page **2. ** Select the Squadron\(s\) to display PEX sorties 

**3. ** Select the month to reconcile 

**4. ** To see all PEX sorties flown on shared tail numbers for any squadron, check the Show Shared Tails box 

**5. ** Click the Go\! button 

PEX will do its best to match PEX and REMIS sorties. A sortie is considered a match if the following data are the same: MDS, Tail Number, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Land Date/Time, Sorties Flown, Total Landings, and Total Full Stops. 

If the above data are not the same, PEX will attempt to match sorties and identify discrepancies. PEX will identify a sortie as a Match with Discrepancies if the Tail \# and Takeoff Date/Time are exactly the samFor the remaining sorties, PEX will match sorties in the same Tail \# with the same Takeoff Date and order them by Takeoff TimPEX will highlight discrepancies in the following areas: MDS, MUC, T/O Date/Time, Landing Date/Time, Hours Flown, Sorties Flown, Total Landing and Total Full Stops. 

The first thing to do is to match unmatched sorties. View unmatched sorties by going to the Unmatched Sorties pagThen: 

**1. ** Select a PEX sortie from the Unmatched PEX Sorties grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid **2. ** Select a REMIS Sortie from the Unmatched REMIS Entries grid to display in Selected Sorties Grid **3. ** When you have decided these sorties should be matched, right-click on the PEX/REMIS sortie pair and click the Match button

**Flying Schedule **

**FS - Setup **

**Introduction **

The Flying Schedule - Setup page allows you to establish requirements for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, Post-Sortie Crew Rest, and Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule by squadron, MDS, and Crew Position. ** **

**Setup Pre-Sortie Crew Rest **

Right-click in the grid and select Add. Select the MDS, the Crew Position \(select the letter indicator in the column of the crew position code that your activity uses. For example, for an F-16 Pilot, select MDS of F-16C 

and P in the D2 Column. \(The D columns are the five Sortie Duty Position characters.\) Under Pre Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Pre-Sortie Crew Rest and whether you want the crew rest added automatical y when the person is scheduled on the first sortie of the day. 

**Setup Post-Sortie Crew Rest **

On the same line as Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, under Post Crew Rest, enter the number of hours required for Post-Sortie Crew Rest, if any. This crew rest will not add automatically. 

108 

**Setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule **

Click the Alternative Crew Rest checkbox. This is all you need to do. This is an alternative to only the Post-Sortie Crew Rest. It does not affect the Pre-Sortie Crew Rest, already established. The implementation is automatic when: 

**1. ** The sortie duration exceeds 16.0 hours. 

**2. ** The Mission Status - TDY checkbox is checked for the sortie Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule commitments have a duration of 1/3 of the sortie duration, not to exceed 96 hours. The generated commitment begins one minute after Scheduled Post Sortie End to prevent display of conflicts between the Post Sortie End and the Post Crew Rest Start. The commitment’s start and end times are adjusted when the schedule is changed, as wel as when Actual times are entered. Once generated, the commitment is not deleted if the duration drops below 16.1 flying hours. The scheduler must remove personnel from the sortie or use the crew details dialog to delete post crew rest commitments. 

Duration of Post-Mission Crew Rest is calculated in hours and rounded to the tenths, e.g., a 26-hour sortie generates an 8.7 hour commitment. To use this feature for off-station missions, ensure that schedulers enter the mission as a single sortie, where the sortie takeoff time is the takeoff time of the first off-station mission and the sortie land time is the land time of the last off-station mission. 

**FS - Sorties **

**Concept. **This page is used to build sorties. It is not used to crew those sorties or to add loads/weapons to those sorties. If you are a flight scheduler, we recommend you do not use this Sorties page. Instead, use the WinPEX-only Mission Board to build your sorties. Then, come back to the Flying Schedule module to crew the sorties and to add loads/weapons. The Mission Board has much more sortie building functionality than this Sorties page. If for some reason, the Mission Board is not available to you, the following instructions explain how to use the less functional Sorties page. ** **

**Setup the Sorties page **

First, hide all the columns that aren’t required: right-click in the header row just below the Date to invoke a context menu, select Grid Settings. At least one mission must be available to invoke the context menu. Click the buttons in the “eye” column that are required, un-check those not required. The Squadrons/Calendar selection grid on left may be hidden by clicking the left-pointing arrow next to “Squadrons”, affording a full Sorties Board view. 

Second, configure column order: click-and-drag the column header and drop to desired placement. Third, and importantly, save these changes by right-click select Save Settings. 

Click Settings> User Preferences. Show cancelled sorties, when checked, the sortie grid displays cancelled missions. These sorties are designated with a strike-through. 

Click Settings> Squadron Preferences. These apply to all users in the squadron. Create mission as RPA mission, when checked, all missions for that squadron are created as RPA missions and are configurable on the RPA schedule. NOTE: RPA missions are not displayed on the Crew page and therefore cannot be crewed in Flying Schedule module. You must use the RPA Schedule module to add crew. 

**Difference between a Mission and a Sortie **

109 

Scheduling 

A mission consists of one or more sorties. A mission always has at least one sortie. A mission could be a trip with multiple segments \(sorties\). A mission could also be a formation, where al the sorties belong together. 

**Add a single sortie **

Click Add Mission and a new line will be generated to enter sortie data. Fill in as many fields as possible. 

Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. 

**Add a formation **

Click Add Formation to open a dialog where formation information can be added, previewed and edited prior to adding it to the schedule. The data entered will display for all sorties in that formation. Fill in as many fields as possible. Come back later and fill in the remaining fields as the data is known. 

**Add a sortie to an existing mission or formation **

Click on the mission or formation. Click Add Mission> Add Sortie to Msn/Formation. This adds a sortie to an existing mission or formation. If a mission, the new sortie’s takeoff time wil be one minute after the previous sortie’s land time. If a formation, the new sortie will assume the settings of the formation’s existing sorties. 

**Copy an existing mission to another day **

Multiple missions may be duplicated to multiple days within a user-selected period of time. To replicate, select Replicate Mission. When the dialog opens, select a squadron and date. When the missions appear, select the source mission or missions. Select which data is to be replicated and the date \(or dates\) for your target missions. You can choose to replicate missions by days of the week within a date span, and by specific dates. Preview your missions with the Add to Preview button. In Preview, mission numbers and start date/time may be edited. Missions can be removed from preview if no longer desired. Click OK to create the mission\(s\) and close the dialog, Cancel to abort, or Apply to create the mission\(s\) and keep the dialog open. 

**Enter actual takeoff and land times **

Double-clicking in the Actual Takeoff and Land Time fields fills them in with current time. To set a different time, select Actions> Adjust Actuals. If you’re entering actual times from a previous day, you must select to show both the actual date and time columns. When you adjust actual, you have to set both the date and time. Enter the takeoff time first then the land time. 

**What’s the difference between deleting a mission and cancel ing it? **

Deleting missions removes them from PEX. Cancelling missions leaves them in PEX but removes all the associated personnel and location commitments. Before going firm on a schedule, delete the mission. After going firm, cancel the mission so it can be tracked historically. 

**Delete missions **

110 

Delete Mission allows you to delete missions individually or multiple missions simultaneously. To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. For multiple missions, a dialog appears allowing you to select missions within a specified date range. Missions created from the replicate process display "Source Mission" information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. Sorties can be deleted from a mission and, if no sorties remain, the mission will be deleted. Missions committed \(firm\) in the Mission Board cannot be deleted here. 

**Cancel missions **

From Actions drop-down, Cancel Mission and Cancel Sortie allow you to cancel missions or sorties. To see canceled sorties, click Settings \(gear icon\), User Preferences, Show cancelled sorties; the cancelled sortie\(s\) will display with strike-through. To uncancel a sortie, highlight the sortie, right-click and select Uncancel Sortie. Committed \(firm\) Missions can be canceled but not deleted. If a committed mission with multiple sorties is cancelled, sorties may be uncanceled individually. An entire mission cannot be uncanceled. 

**Use all the different page controls **

**Squadrons **

Selects which squadrons’ missions/sorties are displayed. Select any combination of squadrons by holding the Ctrl key while clicking. NOTE: if two or more squadrons are selected for display, Add Mission and Delete Mission are disabled. 

**Calendar **

**Zulu**: When selected, the sortie times are based on Zulu. Also, it al ows editing dates and times in Zulu but not Local. 

**Local**: When selected, the sortie times are based on Local. Also, it al ows editing dates and times in Local but not Zulu. NOTE: Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. 

Start/End Date/Time: Defines the time span in which to display missions/sorties. 

**Load Sorties**: Refreshes the sortie display after changing squadron or dates. 

**Page refresh**: \(counter-clockwise-open-arrows\) Refreshes the page. 

**Pin page** \(thumbtack icon\): Any of the four Flying Schedule pages \(Sorties, Crew, Loads, or Setup\) may be 

“pinned’ to open first. This is a user preference. 

**Date Display**: Displays date or date span as selected in the Calendar control, in both normal and Julian formats. Arrow keys allow movement of the date or, if selected, a date span. If a date span is displayed, the span retains the selected number of days. 

**Legend**: Displays a legend describing the color lines used to detail sorties. 

**FS - Crew **

**Concept**. The main purpose of the Crew tab is to schedule people onto sorties. Use the Mission Board to build the sorties, then come here to crew the sorties. A secondary purpose is to schedule people for non-sortie duties, such as meetings and training. 

111 

Scheduling 

**Setup the Crew tab **

**1. ** Set either a Five-Day or One-Day View. To switch to a One-Day View, right-click on the desired day below any existing sorties \(in blank area\) to invoke Expand Day and click it. To toggle back to Five-Day, right-click and click Collapse Day. 

**2. ** Choose which Sortie data to display by clicking the Page Settings icon at top-right \(white box with green arrow\). Go to Setup> Five-Day View. The Five Day View Settings dialog will open. Select either 1 

or 2 Row option, then drag/drop your desired Sortie data columns into Table Columns and order them by drag-and-drop. Click OK. The One-Day View is configured separately using the same procedure. 

**3. ** Choose which Commitment Types to show below the Sorties. This is done from the same Five-Day or One-Day View Settings dialog launched from Page Settings. Simply check desired “Multiple Commitment Types Shown” and “Single Commitment Type Shown”. Most units select Leave/TDY for the Single Commitment Type in order to break out these long-term commitments from the daily meetings and training. Click OK. 

**NOTE:** We recommend not selecting the Mission and Sortie commitment types because they already display above in the Sortie list. 

**4. ** Display a Crew list by selecting an existing personnel filter or creating a new one. Create a new filter by clicking the “funnel” icon, upper-left in the Crew grid. Clear the filter by clicking the red X. 

**Caution**. When using the Flying Schedule Crew tab to schedule personnel onto sorties, you wil experience faster performance by filtering the Crew List to as few people as possible. With a Crew List of about 30 people you will experience satisfactory speed. With a Crew List of over 200 people it will take three to four times longer to crew a sortie. If you experience performance outside these parameters, please contact the PEX Help Desk. 

**5. ** Configure the Crew List to show or hide Availability, Squadron, Stan Eval, and/or RAP: From the Page Settings icon select Setup, then check/un-check from the menu \(below Five-Day and One-Day options\). 

**NOTE:** Hiding the Stan Eval and RAP columns will increase the speed of this page. 

**Pick the sorties to work on **

You can see only one squadron’s sorties at a time. You can see people from multiple squadrons in the Crew List area but in the Sorties area, it’s one squadron at a time. Use the squadron selector above the Crew List to pick the squadron sorties you want to see. Next, select either Z or L, depending on whether you normal y schedule in Zulu or Local. Finally, select the date that you want your five-day view to start on. 

**Schedule crew members onto sorties **

**1. ** Click on the “Check Schedule Report” icon at the top of the Crew List \(green checkmark\). This report identifies scheduling priorities for the selected time frame. Move the report to another monitor or print it. The report includes data for all the personnel in the Crew List. 

**2. ** Click on a sortie to be crewed. Notice the crew list now displays information about each person. 

Referring to the legend, you can tell if the person is overdue for training, on DNIF, on a Restriction, on Supervised Status, already committed, in the zone for an evaluation, and/or their RAP count. Using the information from the Check Schedule report for priorities, schedule a person onto the sortie by drag-112 

and-drop from the Crew List to the Sortie. When your sorties are al crewed, run the Check Schedule report again to see any missed priorities. 

**3. ** To remove someone from a sortie, click on the name and drag it back to the Crew List. You can also drag a person from one sortie to another. You cannot drag a person from a sortie to a commitment below or from a commitment to a sortie. 

**NOTE:** When a person is selected in the Crew List, the name is highlighted everywhere it appears. This wil help you view a person’s weekly schedule at a glance. This is useful for spotting tight turn times between finishing night duty and starting morning duty. 

**NOTE:** If a person is dragged onto a sortie that creates a conflict with another commitment, a Conflict Dialog will display. This dialog will enable you to “Schedule” the person anyway or to “Cancel,” which does not put the person on the sortie. 

**Enter flight authorization and 781 data for the crew **

Once the crew is scheduled, right-click on the sortie and select Crew Details. This Crew Details dialog allows you to order the crew by drag-and-drop. It is also the place to fill in the details of Duty Position, Crew Codes, etc. that populate the flight authorization and AFTO 781. The crew member at the top of the list is considered the Aircraft Commander and will be able to sign off the PEX AFTO 781 Pilot review. To designate the aircraft commander formally for the AF Form4327a, set the first Crew Code to “A”. 

**Hide Tail Numbers for No-Go personnel **

**1. ** In the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences, check the Auto No-Go box. This automatically checks the manual No-Go box for anyone added to a sortie. When the manual No-Go box is checked for any person on the crew, the sortie’s tail number will not be visible to anyone on the crew on the Mission Board, Squadron Daily Schedule, or any Scheduling report. 

**2. ** Back on the Crew tab, once someone verifies a crewmember is good to go, go to the Crew Details dialog and manual y uncheck the No-Go box. Once al crew members on the sortie are unchecked, the tail number will display. 

**NOTE:** This manual checkbox is not tied at all to the automatic Go/No-Go page in PEX. 

**Add Crew Rest **

In the Crew Details dialog, if the Crew Rest and Post Crew Rest columns are not visible, right-click and select Grid Settings. Check the box next to them and click OK. You can setup PEX to auto-add Pre-Sortie Crew Rest. 

This Crew Details dialog is where you can manually add Post-Sortie Crew Rest. 

**NOTE:** To add Post-Sortie Crew Rest automatically using the 1-to-3 rule, refer to the instructions at PEX 

Help> Scheduling> Flying Schedule – Setup> “setup Post-Mission Crew Rest 1-to-3 Rule”. 

**Build and use Crew Templates **

**1. ** A Crew Template is a grouping of crew positions, e.g., two pilots, one navigator, two loadmasters \(P, P, N, L, L\). To create a Crew Template, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed with the desired crew makeup. Right-click and select Save As: Crew Template. Provide the template a Name, e.g., 

“Overwater Nav Crew.” Description is optional. 

113 

Scheduling 

**2. ** To apply a Template to a Sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Template Name to the sortie. To view the crew positions on a Crew Template, click the “\+” icon. To fil the template with actual people, use the Crew tab and drag/drop. 

**Build and use Hard Crews \(Crew Set\) **

**1. ** A Crew Set is a group of specific people \(not crew positions\). To create a Crew Set, right-click on a sortie which has been crewed and select Save As: Crew Set. Provide the crew set a Name, e.g., “R-21”. 

Description is optional. 

**2. ** To schedule a hard crew to a sortie, select the Crew Set tab at lower-left, and drag/drop the Crew Set Name to the sortie. To view people on a Crew Set, click the “\+” icon. 

**Schedule ground commitments from here **

**To add a new commitment. ** While holding down the Ctrl key, drag a person from the Crew List to the Commitment area at lower-right to the desired day. Release the mouse button while stil holding the Ctrl key. A Commitment dialog for the person wil appear. Enter the commitment data, click off the row to save, and close the dialog. The commitment will appear on the Crew tab. If it does not, you have probably chosen to not see this type of commitment. To make it show up, go to Page Settings \(upper-right icon\) and check the desired “Multiple Commitment Types Shown”. 

**To add a person to an existing commitment. ** Drag-and-drop the person from the Crew List onto the commitment. You can build shell commitments, such as Alert, Duty Officer, or SOF on the Commitments Board, then use the Crew tab to fil the commitments.- 

**To remove a person from a commitment. ** Drag-and-drop the person’s name from the commitment back to the Crew List. When you drag the last person off a commitment, you wil be asked if you want the entire commitment deleted. You may want to leave the commitment in place to be filled by someone else later. 

**Schedule an evaluation. ** The person must have an open evaluation in Stan Eval Management and be scheduled on a sortie. Right-click on the sortie and, in the context menu, click Crew Details. On the evaluatee's details row, click on the field in the Evaluation column and view all open evaluations for that person. Select the desired evaluation and click OK. The scheduled evaluation now appears in Stan Eval Management > Eval Details and the evaluatee's My Page under the Stan/Eval section. 

**FS - Loads **

**Concept. **The purpose of the Loads page is to schedule loads \(weapons, ammunition, chaff, flares, cargo, etc.\) on the sortie. The sorties are created in the Mission Board, then come here to schedule the loads on those sorties. Loads can be assigned individually to a sortie or as part of a set \(SCL – Standard Configuration Load\). ** **

**Setup the Loads tab **

There is no setup to be done on the Loads tab itself. Go to another module, the Weapons module, to identify your MDS stations, load items, and build your SCLs. 

**Assign an individual load item to a sortie **

114 

In the grid on the left, select the Loads tab \(at the bottom of the grid.\) Select a Category of load. Then, click on the sortie you wish to assign the load. At the bottom, the Stations Grid will populate with available stations for the MDS assigned the sortie. Finally, click the desired Load Item, and drag it to the desired station \(not to the upper sorties area\). 

**Assign an SCL to a sortie **

In the grid on the left, select the SCLs tab \(at the bottom of the grid.\) \(NOTE: ensure “Req SCL” is selected to display in the Sortie column header, configured from Crew page, Page Settings, Five-Day and/or One day View.\) Click the desired SCL and drag it to the target Sortie \(not to the bottom Stations area\). The SCL name will display in the “Req SCL” column on the sortie grid. \(NOTE: When building SCLs in the Weapons module, we recommend, in addition to listing every named station on the aircraft, also include separate stations for Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares; if these are applicable to your MDS. Normally these items do not go on numbered stations so this is a good way to manage them. 

**Auto-build an SCL number from individual load items **

Many units schedule loads/munitions onto sorties by individual items, each having a code number. The combination of these individual code numbers generates the overal requested loading for the sortie, which in PEX is called Load Code. For example, the first two digits of the code would represent the air-to-ground munition, the second two digits the air-to-air munition, the third two digits the ECM pod, and the last two digits the ammunition. For example, a sortie with an AIM-9X air-to-air missile with a code of 22, a Mk-84 air-to-ground bomb with a code of 37, an ECM pod of code 41, and an ammo loading of 2500 rounds of code 25; would generate an overall Load Code number of 22374125. To use Load Codes in PEX, do the following: Use only a single station on the sortie. Call it whatever you like, “Sortie” would be fine. 

Schedule individual load items onto that station and use drag-and-drop to order them. 

PEX will generate the Load Code and display it on the Mission Board and the Aircraft Status Board. 

**Page Controls **

■ Squadron: Selects which squadron's missions/sorties and ground commitments are displayed. 

■ MDS: Selects which sorties, by MDS, are displayed. Only sorties that are assigned this MDS will display so if you have sorties that do not have an MDS assigned they will not show up or if you have sorties with a different MDS assigned, you wil need to change the MDS selection to view them. 

■ Local/Zulu: Selects whether the missions/sorties displayed for a given date are for that local date or Zulu date. Local date is determined by the user's location set in the Users & Permissions module. 

■ Calendar Control: The double arrows move the display five days at a time. The single arrow moves the display one day at a time. The calendar icon brings up a control that will allow you to select any date. 

■ Last Updated Time: The last time sortie data was updated. 

■ Formation Replication: This is the icon with the capital F located at the top right of the loads grid. When selected it has a down arrow beside it to indicate activation. When activated, any changes made to lead’s load/SCL will be replicated to the wingmen in the formation. 

■ Celestial Data: Sunrise/Sunset, Moonrise/Moonset, and Percent Moon Illumination are calculated based on the user's location's latitude/longitude and date.

**FS - ICBM Schedule **

**Concept**. The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile \(ICBM\) Schedule page is used to develop an alert schedule for up to two months. These alerts take place at various locations. Each alert mission comprises three phases: Alert, Travel \(leaving from the location\), and Off Days. The length of each phase is 24 hours but can be modified. 

**What logic does PEX use to build the alert schedule? **

PEX will auto-schedule personnel onto alert missions using the following rules: 

■ The alert schedule can be generated for 62 days max 

■ The alert is manned with an MCCC \(Mission Commander\). Additional crew members can be MCCCs or DMCCCs \(Deputy Mission Commanders\) 

• If you check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning \(recommended\) and an MCCC is not available, PEX will build the schedule without an MCCC 

• If you don’t check the box Create Schedule with Incomplete Manning and an MCCC is not available, PEX wil not build the schedule 

■ If a person’s crew position is not MCCC or DMCCC, the person wil not be scheduled 

■ If a person's Max Alerts per Month = 0, the person wil not be scheduled 

■ If a person has another commitment on a day, the person wil not be scheduled 

■ If the alert location requires a specific certification, the crew must have that certification with a status of "Is Certified" 

■ A person cannot be scheduled for more than his/her established Max Alerts per Month 116 

!(images/000098.png)

!(images/000036.png)

!(images/000009.png)

■ If a person's Max Alerts per Month is equal to 1 or 2, that person is not scheduled for an Alert sortie that falls on Saturday or Sunday. Travel and Off Days can fall on the weekend but not the Alert. 

■ People with the same crew number sit alert together, when able 

■ If a location specifies a Flight, crew from that flight sit alert together, when able 

■ Available personnel are randomized, so the A’s don't always end up manning the 1st of the month 

■ Available personnel are weighted, so those who got fewer alerts "last period" have a greater probability of getting an alert this period

Replace with another name. 

**Delete a mission **

From the Flying Schedule> Sortie tab, use the Delete Mission Option. Deleting the alert mission\(s\), deletes all three phases. 

**FS - DMO **

**Concept**. The PEX Distributed Mission Operations \(DMO\) module allows geographically separated PEX units to share scheduling information for the purpose of maximizing training. Local PEX units register with their MAJCOM and this registration allows the local units to see the PEX flying/simulator schedules of other registered units. 

After seeing their schedules, you can use PEX to send out support requests. 

**Register my squadron **

**1. ** Navigate to Setup > Squadrons > MAJCOM Registration tab **2. ** Click the Register Squadron button 

**3. ** In the Register Squadron with MAJCOM dialog, from Info Type drop-down select Scheduling **4. ** From the squadron drop-down select the squadron to register **5. ** Enter POC information as required. If your squadron already has POC information entered in the PEX Squadrons module, this information wil be pre-populated here. If the POC for DMO will be different from the one listed, overwrite the data. This will not override the POC information fromthe squadron page; it will be additional just for DMO. 

**6. ** Enter the MAJCOM Name. MAJCOM name wil be pre-populated with the value from the Squadrons module. You can overwrite the information as required. To register a squadron with more than one 119 

Scheduling 

MAJCOM DMO system, just repeat the process using a different MAJCOM name and MAJCOM URL. The MAJCOM URL wil be sent to you; once you have it, copy/paste into the space provided. 

**7. ** Click Save. Clicking Save and New saves the information and clears the form to allow another entry. 

Clicking “Cancel” closes the dialog and no information is saved. 

Once your squadron is registered, the squadron’s status at MAJCOM wil be “waiting for approval.” Your MAJCOM will then approve your registration. Syncing of scheduling data is automatic at pre-determined intervals or can be done manually via the Sync to MAJCOM button in the Flying Scheduling > Sorties tab. 

There is no notification to you that your MAJCOM status has changed. Simply revisit the page or contact your MAJCOM by email or phone if you have any questions. 

**We’re registered. How do we see another unit’s schedule **

**1. ** Go to scheduling > Flying schedule > MAJCOM schedule **2. ** One time, setup your view. Right-click > Grid Settings and select to view DMO Support Requests. 

Select the eyebal for other columns you want to see and the padlock if you want that column locked to the left side of the grid. 

**3. ** Select the registered MAJCOM you wish to view 

**4. ** Set the date range you want to view. The filter selections display items that are scheduled. E.g., if you set a date range and don’t see MC-130P in the MDS list, it means none are scheduled for the selected dates. 

**5. ** You could load the schedule at this time, but you’ll get all missions/sorties for all registered squadrons. This may be too large a list to be of practical use. Pare it down by using the filter selection controls which will narrow your choices as you select each section. The list of squadrons will depend on the MDSs selected. The list of sortie types wil depend on the squadrons selected. 

**6. ** You can Load Sorties any time after you’ve set a date range. After you load the schedule, when you click on a sortie, the support request wil populate under the Msn Support Request at the bottom of page. The POC Information will also display. You can senda request email directly to the POC. 

**Send a support request **

**1. ** Click to highlight the desired sortie/formation > DMO Support Request **2. ** The dialog will contain the Mission Number, Call Sign, and Msn Start/End times. Fill in information pertaining to your request using calendar/time controls and the 250-characterwindow for Mission Scenario. 

**3. ** All other blocks are drop-down choices 

**4. ** Click Save or Save and Close. After saving the request, you are also able to Send Request Notifications. This tells the POC at the other unit to check PEX. It emails the details of your support request to one/some/al of the registered squadrons. When you select "Generate Email" the pre-populated email will appear. Proofread it and send. 

**Temporarily suspend sending my scheduling data **

**1. ** Navigate to Setup > Squadrons > MAJCOM Registration tab 120 

**2. ** Click to highlight the squadron and MAJCOM you wish to deactivate **3. ** Click the Deactivate Connection button, and select OK at the confirmation dialog. The squadron’s record wil be highlighted grey in the display to indicate suspension. 

**Turn it back on **

Select your squadron and click the Renew Connection button. The grey background wil go away and the MAJCOM Approval status wil change to Waiting. Once the MAJCOM approves your connection, your scheduling information will be once again shared.

**Long Range Schedule Setup **

The Long Range Schedule \(LRS\) displays scheduling data in customized views. These data pul from their respective modules. 

■ Commitment Types. Your full-range of Commitment Types \(Duty, TDY, etc.\) 

■ Shift Types. Your full-range of Shift Types \(AM, PM, etc.\) 

■ Personnel filters. 

■ Letter of X Certifications. 

■ Personnel > Teams. 

There are two drop-down controls on the page. In the Personnel filter drop-down, select “\(None\)”. In the Squadron drop-down, select your squadron. You should see a list of people in your squadron and their commitments. 

**Views **

Views allow you to look at different groups of people \(e.g., Pilots, Loadmasters, A Flight, B Flight, Team Alpha, or Team Bravo\) and for each group, a different set of mission requirements \(Shifts, Certifications, and/or Commitments\), and a different set of mission requirement warning flags for each. To setup a view: **1. ** Decide on a group of people to manage, for example “A Flight.” Use the Personnel Filter selector to pick your A Flight filter. Use drag-and-drop to order personnel. 

**2. ** Click the Totals Displayed button. In the dialog, click the arrowheads to expand al the entries. 

**A. ** For Shifts, select the Letter of X certifications \(e.g., Supervisor\) you need to monitor for minimum manning. For example, if you need at least two Supervisors per Shift. 

**B. ** For Commitments, select the Commitment Types \(e.g., Leave\) you need to monitor for maximum allowable. For example, if you want no more than 5 people on leave per day. 

**Warning Flags **

**3. ** Warning Flags button. Click Yes to the Confirm dialog about “… no views created.” 

**A. ** For Shifts: 

**1\)** In the header, where the Shift name is, enter the minimum number of people needed on the shift overall. 

**2\)** Under the Shift name, for each certification, enter the minimum number of people, with that certification, needed on the shift. 

**NOTE:** Even though all the certifications show up, you only need to enter minimum values for the certifications in view \(on the screen behind the dialog.\) 

123 

Scheduling 

**B. ** For Commitments, under the Team name, for each Commitment Type, enter the maximum number of people per day desired. 

**NOTE: **Even though al the commitment types show up, you only need to enter maximum values for the commitment types in view \(on the screen behind the dialog.\) 

**4. ** At top-left, click View > Add. Type in the name of this View, e.g., “A Flight” and click OK. Notice the View shows up as a button at the bottom of the screen. From here on, when you want to see this view, click the button. 

**NOTE**. Views are by-person. If someone else in your unit needs the same view, they need to create it individually – they cannot be shared. 

**5. ** Repeat these steps for additional Views, e.g., “B Flight”. 

**Settings **

**6. ** Click the Settings button. These settings are not by View; they are by-page. Each of your Views will use these settings. 

**A. ** Number of operators per page. Computer performance permitting, select a high number \(e.g., 999\) that captures al your personnel. 

**B. ** Show commitment text. In the LRS schedule blocks for each person/day, PEX wil show the first three characters of the Commitment Name if you check this box. 

**Edit or delete a View. ** To edit a view: select it, make the changes, and click View > Save. To delete it: select it and click View > Delete. 

**Use the Long Range Schedule **

Use the Long Range Schedule to: 

■ Check for scheduling issues, undermanned shifts, and/or excessive commitments. 

■ Add, edit, and delete personnel commitments. 

■ Email PDF schedules to your personnel. 

■ Manage shift patterns, and to add or remove people from shifts. You cannot create Shifts or Shift Templates from the LRS module. Those must be managed in the Shift Schedule module. 

The instructions below apply to a View \(a grouping of people\). If you manage multiple Views \(groups of people\), accomplish the steps below for each View. 

**Check for scheduling issues **

In the calendar area, scroll down and look for any person/date blocks that have a blue triangle at top-right or a red triangle at bottom-right. 

**1. ** Blue triangle indicates multiple commitments are scheduled on that day and one needs to be identified as the primary commitment. 

**A. ** Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog. 

**B. ** Click on the person’s name to see that person’s commitments that day. 

124 

**NOTE**. The red X in the Conflict column simply means the Reviewed checkbox is not checked. It does not mean there is or is not a conflict. 

**C. ** In the Display column, pick the main commitment for the day. This one shows on the calendar and is the one that counts in the totals below. 

**D. ** In the Reviewed column, check the box and click OK. 

**E. ** Notice in the person/date block, the main commitment is displayed and the blue triangle is gone \(indicating you’ve reviewed this block\). 

**2. ** Red Triangle indicates conflicting commitments. 

**A. ** Click on the person/date block to open the Commitments dialog. 

**B. ** Click on the person’s name to see that person’s commitments that day. 

**C. ** Edit the commitments to eliminate the conflict or accept the conflict. 

**Check for undermanned shifts **

In the bottom section of the screen, under Shift Types, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have either a Shift undermanned and/or a specific certification on a Shift undermanned. 

**Check for excessive commitments **

In the bottom section of the screen, under Teams, look for any blocks in red. This is where you have too many people on that Commitment Type that day. 

**Check personnel by Qualifications & Certifications **

This displays individuals' MDS/CP qualifications and LoX Certifications. 

**1. ** At top-left, directly below View, click the > icon. This opens the Quals & Certs grid. 

**2. ** Drag the gray vertical bar to the right to expand the grid area. You should see a blank panel with 

"Select operator\(s\) to view quals and certs." 

**3. ** Populate the Quals & Certs grid. In the Operators list area, check the individual personnel checkboxes, or right-click and click Select All Operators. 

**4. ** In the Quals & Certs grid, right-click > Grid Settings to select which columns to view. 

**Add a commitment **

Normally, commitments are managed in the Commitments Board module due to its greater functionality. 

However, to enter commitments directly from the LRS, the fol owing is the best way: **1. ** On the person/date block, right-click and select Add Commitment **2. ** Notice the date and person are already filled in. Enter the remaining data and click Save and Close. 

**Edit a Commitment **

125 

Scheduling 

Click on a person’s commitment block to open the dialog showing all commitments for that person on that date. Highlight the Commitment and click Edit Commitment. Make the change and click Save. 

**NOTE**. You cannot edit sorties or shifts from the LRS. Edit those in the Flying Schedule and Shift Schedule modules. 

**See all commitment details for a single day **

Click on the date at the top of the column. A dialog displays the personnel. Right-click and select Expand All. 

**Email the schedule to people **

**1. ** Click the Email icon 

**2. ** Pick the date range for the schedule you want to send **3. ** n addition to the schedule \(Commitments\), select which other sections to include **4. ** Pick the personnel you want the email to go out to 

**5. ** Click Edit Remarks and enter any comments you want to go out **6. ** Click View PDF to see what the report wil look like 

**7. ** In the Email area, type in your email address and click the Send Email button. Each person will get an individual email with only their report. The Cc person will get copies of all the individual emails, not a single email with a consolidated report. 

**How do I build recurring shift patterns using the LRS? ** A recurring shift pattern is something like four days on, two days off, etc. You can build a shift pattern from the LRS module or the Shift Schedule module. To build one from the LRS, click the Shifts icon and Manage Shift Patterns command. For detailed instructions, see Managing Your Shifts.  

**Mission Board **

**Setup **

**Concept**. The Mission Board \(MB\) is used to build a flying schedule. Individual missions are created as either single sorties, formations, or trips. Airspace sortie events are added here. Once the missions are created in the MB, Crew and Loads are scheduled to those missions in the Flying Schedule module. You can tailor the MB to your flying mission. 

**How do I setup the MB? ** Fol owing are the steps needed to configure the MB for your unique flight scheduling operation. However, you may not need to do them if someone in your office has created a MB 

template. To find out, go to MB> Tools> Template Manager and see if your office has a template listed. It would normally be named something like “757TS Flight Scheduling”. If so, go ahead and Open it, close the MB, and come back to the MB. If you applied a template, you should skip the steps below. 

**1. ** **Pick your View, Fighter or Standard. ** There are two available views. The Standard View \(S icon below the menu bar\) is for missions requiring a large amount of detailed information regarding sorties, events, and timing. This “S” view is normally used by Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, and other large aircraft. The Fighter View \(F icon below the menu bar\) is normally used by Fighters and Trainer aircraft. 

**2. ** **Pick your columns. ** Go to View> Hide/Unhide Columns and select the columns to display \(you need to have a least one selection in each list\). 

126 

**3. ** **Order and size your columns. ** Drag-and-drop the columns to the order you want by double left clicking on them, holding the column header, and dragging it to the proper location. Size the column by left clicking and holding on the right edge of the column and drag it either right or left to size it appropriately. 

**4. ** **Set your Add Sortie preferences. ** Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie tab. Select the MDS 

and Flying Plan to default when you add a sortie. 

**5. ** **Set your Add Sortie Event preferences. ** Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Add Sortie Events tab. 

Select the default takeoff and land locations, crew show time, crew brief time, and crew post-sortie end time. Post-sortie end time is how much time you want to al ow the crew after they land to complete paperwork before you schedule them for something else. 

**6. ** **Change Takeoff Time preference. ** Go to Tools> Pre-Mission Settings> Change Takeoff Time tab. Tell PEX what to do when you change the takeoff time. We recommend you select Changes Show and Brief Dates/Times by Offset. 

**7. ** **Set MB User Options. ** Go to Tools> Options. 

**A. ** Set the Location Source to PEX 

**B. ** If your part-time personnel use the PEX Availability inputs, enable the Availability selection **C. ** Select Sorties by Takeoff Date to exclude sorties that took off yesterday but land today **D. ** Choose whether to see Cancelled Missions/Sorties 

**E. ** If you schedule traditional formations \(all sorties on one flight plan\), check the box for Auto Replicate Formation Data 

**8. ** **Set MB Squadron Options** 

**A. ** **Airspace** 

**1\)** Fighters and Trainers. If your sorties typically go to one airspace per sortie, pick “Airspace” 

once. Leave the others blank. If your sorties go to two airspaces per sortie, like a MOA and an AR 

Track, pick Airspace twice. And so on, up to five. 

**2\)** Airlift, Bombers, Tankers, etc. Leave Blank. Use Sortie Event Sets instead. 

**3\)** Adjust your columns in the Sorties grid to account for these new columns. 

**B. ** **Actual Takeoff and Land Time Deviations. ** The MB will highlight actual takeoff and land times outside the minutes you set here. 

**C. ** **PFPS**. Leave blank. 

**D. ** **Supervisor Types**. You can schedule up to three types of supervisors from the MB. Pick the three types here. 

**E. ** **RPA Unit**. Select the box for “Create MSN as RPA MSN”. This sets different logic on the missions add and al ows the use of the RPA Scheduler module. 

**F. ** **Auto No-Go**. The MB includes a manual No-Go process, not linked to the Go/No-Go module in PEX. Enable Auto No-Go to mark all your people as No-Go on the MB until you manual y check them as Go. This feature is used in our tail number denial process. 

**G. ** **Auto Sortie Numbering**. The “Enable Auto Sortie \#/Line \#” adds a sortie number and line number to each sortie. Enter the starting Line Number. When you add sorties, PEX wil number them for you. 

**H. ** **Change Notifications**. The “Set Change Notifications” button allows you to select which fields trigger change notification actions. 

127 

Scheduling 

**9. ** **Save your setup as a template for others**. To save others in your office the time of setting up their MBs from scratch and to have a standardized view across the office, save your MB as a template. To do so, go to Tools> Template Manager and select Save As. Give the template a name such as “757TS Flight Scheduling.” 

**Build Sorties **

**What’s the difference between a Mission and a Sortie? ** In PEX, sorties belong to a mission. A mission could have just one sortie, plain and simple, think bombers and tankers. Alternatively, a mission could include multiple sorties, a trip, an aircraft and crew that fly multiple sorties, think airlift. A mission could also be comprised or formation sorties, think fighters and trainers. 

**How do I build a single-sortie mission? ** Click the "\+ M" icon on the menu bar. A new line will be generated in the Mission and Sorties grids. In the Mission grid, enter a Mission Number. In the Sorties grid, enter your sortie data. The Sortie times will drive the Mission Times. 

**How do I build a trip mission? **

**1. ** Go to Tools> Options and turn off Sorties by Takeoff Date. If you don’t do this, when you add a sortie on a different day, the sortie will “disappear” to its assigned takeoff date. 

**2. ** To build a mission with multiple legs, start by adding a mission with a single sortie as described above. Once the mission is added and the data is added for the first sortie, right-click on that sortie and select Add Sortie to Mission. Once this is done a sortie wil be added with the takeoff time being one minute after the land time of the previous sortie. Also, the takeoff location be set to the land location of the previous sortie. Edit the second sortie data as necessary. To add another sortie, just repeat the process. 

**How do I build a formation mission? ** Click the "\+ F" icon on the menu bar. Once you get the Add Formation dialog, enter your data. A field marked with an asterisk “\*” is mandatory. The dialog is divided into three areas: Basic Sortie Data, Airspace, and View. The first two areas are self-explanatory. The View grid is useful for adding additional formation data. The crew members and call signs can be entered on 

“Summary/Crewmembers” page. By clicking on the “Other Formation Data” you can enter other data pertaining to the formation. Once you complete the dialog data entry, click OK to add the formation to the MB. 

**How can I break up a 4-ship into two 2-ships \(or vice versa\)? ** Right-click on a sortie and select Move Selected Sortie to Formation. “New” wil create a new formation. The sortie wil keep the line \# and the tail number when moved. 

**How do I copy a sortie, a formation, an entire day, or an entire week? ** You can replicate a mission or multiple missions to different days using the Replicate Mission\(s\) function. To replicate a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Replicate Mission\(s\). A dialog will appear that will allow you to select a date range to choose which missions you want to replicate \(use the CTRL key to multi-select\). Then choose what data you want to replicate. Finally, you can select a date range and add the missions by the day of the week or just a day. Once the missions and dates are selected, click Apply or OK. If you click Apply, the dialog will remain open for more replication. 

**How do I delete a single sortie? ** Right-click delete. The last sortie in a mission wil not delete. You need to delete the mission in this case. 

**How do I delete a mission? ** Show the Mission grid if it’s hidden \(the M icon with a red slash\). To delete a single mission, highlight the mission, right-click and select Delete Mission. To delete multiple missions, right-click in the Missions grid and select Delete Missions. . A dialog will appear that allows you to select missions 128 

within a specified date range. Missions that were created from the replication process display Source Mission information. Missions that were created from scratch will not show any source mission information. 

NOTE, once a mission has been committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. 

**Mission Events **

**What are Mission Events? ** Mission Events are action items associated to the mission. Example mission events are: Coordinate PPR, Submit ICAO Flight Plan, Mobility Processing, briefings, etc. Mission Events are a good place to track these things. 

**How do I add a Mission Event? ** Place the cursor in the Mission Events grid, right-click and select Add Mission Event. A line will be generated to enter the event. 

**How do I delete a Mission Event? ** Right-click on it and select Delete Mission Event. 

**How do I add a group of Mission Events? ** Mission Event Sets are useful when the same mission events are used repeatedly with maybe only the dates changing. Using a Mission Event Set you don’t have to build the profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Mission Event Set to a mission and identify a new base date. Al the other dates wil adjust accordingly. 

**How do I create a Mission Event Set? ** Enter the individual events in the Mission Events grid with dates and then right-click and select Save Mission Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Mission Event Sets grid on the Mission Events Builder tab. 

**How do I add a Mission Event Set to a mission? ** Highlight the desired mission and select the Mission Events Builder tab. Highlight the set in the Available Mission Event Sets grid and click the Add Set to Mission button. 

A dialog will appear requesting a date to offset. All the events will offset from that date. A dialog will appear asking what to do about existing Mission Events, always select Yes. 

**How do I clear al Mission Events? ** Click Clear Mission Events. This deletes all mission events except Show and Post Mission End. 

**How can I freeze a Mission Event date/time? ** Click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. 

**Sortie Events **

**What are Sortie Events? ** Sortie Events are defined as a group of events that will be accomplished just before, during, and after the sortie. When you add a sortie in PEX, it comes with five standard sortie events: Show, Brief T/O, Land, and Post Sortie End. You can add others such as: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, Area Entry, and Area Exit. Sortie events can be added in the Standard view on the Mission Builder or by clicking on the Sortie Events tab. The Sortie Events grid or tab displays sortie events assigned to the highlighted sortie. Sortie events can be assigned individually or as a set to a selected sortie. 

**How do I add individual sortie events? ** Right-click in the Sortie Events grid and select Add Sortie Event. A new line wil be generated to enter the event. 

**How do I delete an individual sortie event? ** Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event. 

**What are Sortie Event Sets? ** Sortie Event Sets are useful when the same sortie profile is flown repeatedly with maybe only the times/dates changing. You don’t have to build the sortie profile from scratch each time, only the first time. Subsequently, you can simply add a Sortie Event set to a sortie and identify a new base time. All the other times will be adjusted accordingly. 

129 

Scheduling 

**How do I build a Sortie Event Set? ** Enter the individual events in the Sortie Events grid or the Sortie Events Builder tab with dates and times and then right-click in the grid and select, Save Sortie Event Set. A dialog box will appear asking for a name and description for the set. When completed, the set will be saved and the set name will appear in the Available Sortie Event Sets grid on the Sortie Events Builder tab. 

**How do I use a Sortie Event Set? ** To add a set to a sortie in the Sortie Events Builder tab, highlight the set and click the Add Set to Sortie button. A dialog will appear requesting a date and time to offset. All the other sortie events will offset from that date and time. Once you set the times and click “OK” another dialog will appear that says “Some events in the set already exist in the Sortie”. You have three options but we recommend that you use “Yes” which wil replace al the sortie events. 

**How can I use a Sortie Event Set and stil retain my original ARCT data? ** When PEX sees an ARCT sortie event on your original sortie, the Add Set to Sortie dialog wil come up with the Sortie Event Set ARCT event pre-selected and the checkbox "Retain Original ARCT Data" deselected. If you want to apply your standard routing and retain the ARCT and associated \(altitudes, call signs, etc.\) then all you have to do is select the 

“Retain Original ARCT Data” and click OK. 

**How do I delete a Sortie Event Set? ** Right-click on it and select Delete Sortie Event Set. 

**How do I clear the sortie events off a sortie? ** Right-click on the sortie and select Clear Sortie Events on the Mission Builder/Standard View or the Sortie Events Builder tab. This deletes all except Show, Brief, Takeoff, Land, and Post Sortie End. 

**How do I freeze sortie event times so they don’t change? ** Right-click Freeze/Unfreeze Date/Time. Freezing a date/time prevents cascade options from taking effect. Frozen date/times are displayed with a blue background. Checking the CT box wil do the same. 

**Schedule AR Tracks **

**How do I schedule Air Refueling \(AR\)? **

Use Sortie Events to schedule the AR. In every case, enter the pertinent AR data \(Cal Sign, Onload, Altitude, etc.\) on the ARCP sortie event. AR Track Duration is calculated between the ARCP time and AREX time. In the case of a Reverse Track, enter the pertinent AR data on the first ARCP sortie event of the sequence and the Track Duration is calculated between the first ARCP and the final AR point in the sequence. There are four options for scheduling AR. Use the one that best suits your mission: **1. ** **Simple**. Schedule just an ARCP sortie event. 

**2. ** **Standard**. Schedule ARIP, ARCP, and AREX sortie events. 

**3. ** **Multiple ARs**. Schedule the first one as a standard AR track \(ARIP, ARCP, and AREX\), insert some other, non-AR, sortie event\(s\) after the AREX, then add the next AR track \(ARIP, ARCP, and AREX\). 

**4. ** **Reverse AR**. On the first ARCP sortie event, check the Reverse Track checkbox. Schedule the sequence as either: 

**A. ** ARIP, ARCP, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP \(if the time to the AREX is also scheduled/control ed\) **B. ** ARIP, ARCP, ARIP \(if the time to the AREX is not scheduled/control ed\) **Scheduling Supervisors **

**Concept**. PEX al ows you to schedule up to three different kinds of squadron supervisors, e.g., SOF, Top 3, and Mobile. You decide as a squadron which three types to schedule. The supervisor schedule is displayed on the Mission Board, Commitments Board, and the scheduling reports. 

130 

**How do I set it up? **

**1. ** The first thing to do is to setup your squadron’s Letter of X in PEX so that PEX knows who your supervisors are. 

**2. ** Once you have created and assigned the certifications, go to the Mission Board> Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences. In the Supervisor Type area, select one Supervisor Type per line, up to three, e.g., SOF, Mobile, and TOP 3. Then click OK. Now that PEX knows your desired Supervisor Types and who meets those Certifications, you can schedule them. 

**It’s setup. How do I schedule them? **

To schedule supervisors, go to Mission Board> Tools> Schedule Supervisors. A dialog will appear. Right-click in the grid and select Add Supervisor Commitment. Select a Supervisor Type, then in the Short Name list select the person you want to schedule. Final y, enter the length of the commitment, any remarks, and click on another row to save \(if only one row is in view, click on the header to save\). Once you have entered al supervisors’ commitments, click OK to close the dialog. To display or check the supervisor’s schedule, click on the Faces” icon on the toolbar. 

**Troubleshooting **

A supervisor wil not appear in the supervisor drop down for one of three reasons: 

■ They are not assigned an “is certified” status in Letter of X 

■ They are expired in the respective certification in Letter of X 

■ They are “decertified” with cause in the respective certification in Letter of X 

**Lock Schedule **

**Concept**. After the flying schedule is built, you can lock key portions to prevent changes or at least require coordination between Operations and Maintenance before making the change. You can lock one sortie, a day, or a span of days. You can lock Takeoff Time, Land Time, SCL, Aircraft Configuration, MX Line Number, Tail Number, and SCL. 

**Permissions **

PEXAdmin and squadron administrators. 

**How do I lock the schedule? ** To lock a day or multiple days at once, display the day\(s\) you want to lock on the Mission Board, then click the Lock icon on the toolbar. To lock one sortie at a time, right-click on the sortie and select Lock Sortie. 

**NOTE**: If you do not have a Tail \# or MDS identified in the sortie line, those fields will not lock. Once you add the Tail \# or MDS you will have to re-lock the sortie. 

**How do I unlock the schedule? ** Once a schedule is locked, it can be unlocked only one sortie at a time. Right-click on the sortie and select "Unlock Sortie." Once unlocked, changes can be made and the sortie can be locked again. 

**Track Changes **

**Concept**. While working in the MB, changes are not tracked until you “Commit” the mission \(go firm\). Once committed, when you make a change to a tracked item, PEX al ows you to enter details about the change. 

To identify which items are tracked, go to Tools> Options> Squadron Preferences> Set Change Notifications. 

Once the tracking data is entered, you can notify the change to personnel. 

131 

Scheduling 

**How do I commit missions? ** Normal y, they should be committed when higher authority approves the schedule. To commit a mission, right-click in the Missions grid and select Commit Mission\(s\). This allows you to commit all or some missions on a day or a range of days. 

**My missions are committed. What happens now? ** When you make a change to a tracked field and click off the mission \(not just the sortie\), PEX launches a change notification dialog where you type in why the change was made. In this dialog, fill in the Authorized By, Description, Item Affected, and Remarks, Effective Date \(L\), and Effective Time \(L\) fields. This data wil be sent to recipients and entered on your PEX-generated AF 

2407. If you simply want to track this change, click OK. If you want to notify the change, continue reading. 

**How do I notify the change? ** In the Mission Change dialog, click the Add Mission Crew button, then click OK. 

This will launch your email with the crew already addressed. Use your email software to add other recipients as desired. When complete, send the email. 

**Can I delete a committed mission? ** No, once a mission is committed, it cannot be deleted, only canceled. 

Cancellation may be recorded as a mission change. 

**How do I cancel a mission? ** To cancel a mission that has been committed, highlight the mission, right-click and select Cancel Mission or check the Cnx box on the Mission line. Once a mission is canceled, all sorties, location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that mission are cancelled too. Missions that are canceled are not editable except for the Cnx and Msn Cancel Cause columns. If the mission is not canceled, the Msn Cancel Cause field is not editable. 

**How do I un-cancel a mission? ** Uncheck the Cnx checkbox in the Missions grid. When a mission is uncanceled, all associated sorties will be un-canceled and commitments will be re-engaged for personnel, aircraft, and locations. 

**How do I cancel a single sortie, not the entire mission? ** Only sorties of committed missions may be cancelled. The cancel sortie checkbox, Cnx, is located in the Sortie grid. Once a sortie has been canceled, al location, aircraft, and personnel commitment records attached to that sortie are cancelled. 

**How do I un-cancel a sortie? ** Un-cancel a sortie by un-checking the Cnx checkbox in the Sorties grid. When a sortie is un-canceled, all commitments are re-engaged. A sortie can be un-canceled if its mission is not canceled. 

**Tail Number Denial **

**Concept**. You can hide aircraft tail numbers from the crew until they are in a "Go” status. The purpose of this feature is to prevent crew from stepping to the aircraft before accomplishing required items. This is a completely manual process not linked to the PEX Go/No-Go page. 

**How do I set this up? **

**1. ** On the MB, go to View> and unselect Show Tail Numbers. 

**2. ** On the MB, go to Tools> Options> Squadron, and enable Auto No-Go. When you add people to sorties, PEX will automatically mark their manual No-Go box. 

**How do I use it? **

**1. ** Add people to sorties as you normal y would. They come in with the manual No-Go box checked. 

The sortie tail number is hidden if anyone on the crew is marked No-Go. 

**2. ** Verify a person has completed all required actions for proceeding to the aircraft and uncheck their box. For one or two person crews, the box can be unchecked from the MB Sorties grid. For crews of three or more, the box must be unchecked in the Flying Schedule> Crew tab> Crew Details dialog. Only 132 

the following permission roles can uncheck the box: Ops Desk, Training Auditor/Arms, Administrator, and Flight Schedulers. 

**3. ** When al crew on a sortie have unchecked No-Go boxes, the tail number will display. 

**How does this affect Maintenance? ** The MX Scheduling permission role has permission to see tail numbers at all times. 

**Export to TAP **

**Concept**. This function allows you to export PEX mission data to a file that can be imported by the TBMCS 

\(Theater Battle Management Core Systems\) Force Level TAP \(Theater Air Planner\). Use this function to add missions developed in PEX to the Air Tasking Order \(ATO\). This function is mostly used by Special Forces. 

**How do I use it? **

**1. ** Build your missions/sorties normally in PEX. Enter as much TAP data as you have for the sortie on each of the sortie events you want to export to TAP. Check the Sortie Event "CT" block for sortie events with control times. 

**2. ** PEX data exported to the TAP file comes from the following fields: **TAP FILE FIELD **

MISSION REMARKS 



**NOTE**: PEX automatically removes dashes from MDSs. E.g., "MC-130" will export as "MC130". 

**3. ** When ready to create the TAP export file, in the PEX MB, select "Tools, Export to TAP…" The "Export to TAP" dialog will appear. The dialog will display all the same missions/sorties displayed on the Mission Board. 

**A. ** Using the "Export TAP File Location/Name" browse button, select the location and name to save the file about to be created. 

**B. ** \(If known\) Type in the ATO ID, ACO, and Revision \#. 

**C. ** Enter your ATO Unit ID and Service. Click "Save Settings" to enter this Unit ID and Service for all your missions. 

**D. ** Select the missions you want exported to the file. Each PEX mission selected wil generate an 

"AIRMSN" record on the export file. 

**E. ** From among the missions you select for export, select the events you want to export. Clicking the "Show only CT Events" box wil filter your list down to just events that have control times. Each PEX sortie event selected wil generate a "TASK" record on the export file. 

**F. ** When you have al the missions and events selected, click "Export." The generated file can be imported by TAP. 

**Distance, Time, and Fuel **

**Concept**. The Mission Board, Sortie Events grid displays the exact distance, approximate time, and approximate fuel between event points. It also provides totals of all the above in the Post Sortie End line. 

These figures provide the scheduler an estimate of fuel required for the sortie. It does not, obviously, replace detailed crew mission planning. 

**How do I set this up? **

134 

**1. ** Aircraft Module. In the Aircraft MDS grid, enter the average speed \(KTAS\) and average fuel flow for the MDS. Fuel flow can be entered as any amount per hour, e.g., pounds per hour or gal ons per hour. 

**2. ** Locations Module. Enter latitudes and longitudes for all your flying locations or at least the ones you use frequently. 

**OK, how do I use it? **

**1. ** Schedule sortie events the way you normally do, making sure a location is specified. 

**2. ** **Distance**. PEX calculates the great circle distance \(NM\) between your sortie event points. If an event has no location specified or the location has al zeroes for the lat/long, PEX wil skip over that event and calculate the distance to the next event. 

**3. ** **Time**. PEX divides the distance by the average speed to derive a calculated \(approximate\) time, then PEX uses the greater of Calculated Time or Scheduled Time. 

**A. ** If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is less than the Scheduled Time, PEX wil use the Scheduled Time. For example, if PEX calculates it wil take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule 30 minutes, PEX wil use 30 minutes as the time. 

**B. ** If the Calculated Time between two Sortie Events is more than the Scheduled Time, PEX uses the Calculated Time. For example, if PEX calculates it will take 15 minutes to get somewhere but you schedule only 10 minutes, PEX wil 15 minutes as the time. 

**4. ** **Fuel**. PEX multiplies the time by the average fuel flow to calculate the approximate fuel \(pounds or gal ons depending on how the fuel flow was entered\). 

**5. ** Use the bottom-line \(Post Sortie End\) sortie event to get an idea of how much fuel is needed for the sortie. 

**Miscellaneous **

**Deconfliction**. As you add people and aircraft to the schedule, PEX compares the mission start date/time and the mission end date/time to other commitments. If there are conflicts, a message box will appear that asks, "Possible conflicts. Do you still want to add item?” If you select “Yes”, the person or aircraft will be added to the schedule. 

**Can I use the MB for display? ** The Squadron Daily Schedule module was designed as a replacement for using the MB as a flight schedule display. However, if you prefer to use the MB in a Full Screen, Auto-Refresh mode, select File> Ful Screen. While in Ful Screen mode, the record of interest is not indicated by a dark blue line like it normally is, but all MB functionality is available. To exit Ful Screen, hold down the Alt key and hit F twice. 

**Can I use the MB for JTAC Scheduling? ** Yes, you should. Joint Terminal Air Control \(JTAC\) missions could be scheduled using the Commitments Board \(CB\); however, better functionality is obtained by using the MB. 

Using the MB, you can copy and paste large Remarks into the Mission Remarks field. With the CB, the Remarks have to be copied one line at a time. Using the MB, you generate a Sortie Details Report on My Page, where your JTAC personnel can see what they are scheduled for and the other personnel on the mission \(neither of which is obtained by using the CB\). 

What do the colored names mean? 

■ Red indicates overdue a Priority 1 training task \(supervision required\) 

■ Orange indicates manual No-Go 

■ Blue indicates both of the above 

135 

Scheduling 

**How do I enter actual takeoff and land times? ** Click on the “clock with an A” icon and the actual time fields wil display in the Sortie grid. If you want to enter the current time, just click in the time field. If you want to change it from current time, click in the field and edit. If the time has already been saved, you will need to right-click on the time field and select “Adjust Actual” then you can change the times. This is to prevent accidental changes. If you click on the field for sorties at least one day in the past it will put scheduled time in the field. 

**Can I filter the list of sorties? ** Yes, click on the Filter icon. You can filter by MDS, Sortie Type, or both. This is useful if you want to filter out simulators and/or alert sorties. 

**What do the other icons do? **

■ M Icon with a slash through it - will hide the Mission grid if you have the Fighter view Selected 

■ The M icon with a line up and down - expands the Mission grid in the Standard view 

■ The S icon with a line up and down - expands the Sorties grid in the Standard view 

■ The S\# icon - will re-number your sorties 

■ The L\# icon - will re-number your line numbers 

■ The icon with two heads - displays the Supervisor schedule 

**Custom Flight Schedule **

This function is no longer available; it has been made obsolete by the Scheduling Reports, especially the Custom Schedule. 

**Personnel Availability **

**Displaying Personnel Availability Data **

**1. ** Select a squadron in the Squadron drop-down list that has scheduled availability periods. 

**2. ** Select a person from the Personnel drop-down list. When a person is selected, the Availability grid will display the selected person’s availability data from the database and the date it was last updated. 

In the Availability grid, ToolTip notations on the Date field will list the day of the week/Julian Scheduling date and ToolTips on the Availability Type code field will list the Availability Type Description. 

**Updating Personnel Availability Electronically **

This is a three-step process. First, create a Personnel Availability Import File and send it to your personnel. 

Second, as the files are returned completed, you store them in a folder. Third, when you are ready, import the data. 

**1. ** Creating the Personnel Availability Import File. This is a single file that you will send out to your squadron personnel where they can fill in, by month, when and how they are available. The file will automatically include your squadron's Availability Periods and Availability Types. Select "Tools, Create Import File. ." to launch the dialog. Then, select the Month/Year for which you want availability entered and click "Create File." The file will automatically be saved to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Outgoing folder unless you specify otherwise. Now that the file is created, use your Email software to send it to your personnel. The file includes instructions on how to fill it out. 

**2. ** Storing Filled-In Import Files. As your personnel return the files filled in with their availability, save them to Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder or as desired. 

136 

**3. ** Importing Personnel Availability Files. Select the squadron for which you want to import personnel availability data. Then, select "Tools, Import Availability. ." to launch the dialog. Click "Select Files" to see a list of all the files available for import, these files will normally be located at Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming folder unless you have specified otherwise. Once you have selected your desired files, normally select all of them, click OK. The selected files will be listed and you can then click "Import." Once a file has been successfully read and entered into the PEX database, the file will be automatically renamed "Imported" \+ the original file name. 

Changes. Personnel can use the same import file to update availability data they previously sent you. They simply re-do their availability for the month and send it to you. You will know they are changing their availability by receipt of a another file for the same month. When you import the updated file, it will delete their previous inputs for the month and replace it with the new. 

Errors. A log file is created each time files are imported. If personnel make errors filling out the import file, the specific error is listed so you can go into the file and fix it. Any file with errors will remain in the Patriot Excalibur/Personnel Availability/Incoming directory until successfully imported. 

**Adding Personnel Availability Data Manually **

**1. ** For one or few days: Select the days on the calendar in the Select By Day section and click Add. This wil move the selected day to the Selected Days list box. Or, 

**2. ** For many days, use the Select by Days of Week grouping: **A. ** Set the Date Span inside of which the available days will fall. 

**B. ** Select the All Days radio button to set all of the days in the Date Span inside the Selected Days window or select the By Day radio button to set multiple instances of a certain day, and select the check boxes of the days to place in the Selected Days list. 

**3. ** Once the days are selected, set period availability by highlighting the days in the Selected Days list. 

The highlighting may be done individually or all days may be highlighted using the Select Al button. The Unselect All button will remove the highlighting from all highlighted days in the list box. 

**4. ** Use the Set Availability group to assign availability either All Day or By Period, the periods as Hard or Soft, and the Availability Types. Click Add to send the date\(s\) and availability to the Availability grid. 

Select Apply to save the data to the database. 

**NOTE:** The meaning of Hard and Soft is unit-defined. E.g., Hard could mean the crewmember will show up for whatever is scheduled without the scheduler double-checking. Soft could mean that the crewmember is probably available but the scheduler should check before relying on the crewmember to actual y show up. 

**NOTE:** Availability Types are unit-defined in Setup, Validation. 

**Removing Personnel Availability Data Manually **

Remove days from the Availability grid by selecting one or more days and pressing the Remove button. The dates will be moved from the Availability grid to the Selected Days list. To remove a day completely, highlight it and click Remove in the Selected Days group. To change the availability, see next paragraph. 

**Editing Personnel Availability Data Manually **

**1. ** Select the date in the Availability grid, and click the Remove button. 

**2. ** The date will be removed from the Availability grid and added to the Selected Days list. 

137

**Scheduling Reports **

**Flying Schedules - General **

**How do I use the Flying Schedule Reports? ** These are the new schedules, found under Scheduling> Reports. 

**1. ** Select the format of the schedule you want, e.g., Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule. For Fighter and Trainer units, we recommend the Custom Schedule Report. 

**2. ** Start by selecting the date range, time display \(local or ZULU\) and Only Sorties that Flew \(sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board\) as required. Select the Squadron\(s\) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS\(s\) you want to appear on the report. Show \(Rows\) allows you to pick more qualifiers for the data you want to display. 

**3. ** Move on to the "Ground" tab and select what ground scheduling data \(Personnel Commitments\) you want to appear on the report. 

**A. ** In the "Show" area, select whether to even display the "Ground" data at al and whether to label the entire schedule as "SECRET." 

**B. ** Select the squadron\(s\) from which you want personnel commitments to appear. 

**C. ** Select the Supervisor types from the selected squadrons. 

**D. ** Select the Commitment types you want to appear from the selected squadrons. 

**4. ** Select "PDF" to get a read-only type file or "Excel" to get an editable file. 

**5. ** Your selections for each schedule \(e.g., Fighter or Bomber\) are saved as user preferences. 

**6. ** Times. "\(L\)" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 \(L\) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data \(L\) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. 

**7. ** Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, and select the items to track \(show in red\) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values \(i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration\) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither wil the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category \("WX"\). 

**8. ** Air Refueling \(AR\) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR 

sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data \(Seq \#, Alt, Rz Type, for example\) on the ARIP line and the rest \(Onload, Priority, for example\) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq \#, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule wil print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number "1201" on the ARIP line and 

"1502" on the ARCP line; it's the "1201" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. 

151 

Scheduling 

Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the ”Reverse Track” box on the first 

”AREX” sortie event. PEX wil then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP 

time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the fol owing sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX \(which is really the geographic ARIP\). 

**9. ** Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules \(except Custom Schedule\) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP \(Initial Point\) Time, and/or Exit Time. 

**A. ** If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: **1\)** Entry time: "LL EP", "Area Entry", and "ALTN EP" 

**2\)** IP time: "IP" \(but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX\) **3\)** Exit time: "LL EX", "Area Exit", and "ALTN EX" 

**NOTE**: If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same \(e.g., IR 275\), PEX will list the times on one line. 

If the locations are different \(e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ\), PEX will list the times on separate lines. 

**B. ** If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. 

**C. ** If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. 

**10. ** Miscellaneous. 

**A. ** If "IAF" is entered as a sortie event on the Bomber Schedule, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and "Pattern Time" wil calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. 

**B. ** If ”Bus” is entered as a sortie event, the ”Bus” local time will show. 

**C. ** Crew will show up in the same order as on the Flying Schedule/Crew module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Flying Schedule> Crew tab. 

**D. ** If a person is assigned a WX Cat \(Personnel> Quals & Certs\), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS 

qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty. 

**MADO \(Missile Alert Duty Order\) **

**1. ** Select the format of the schedule you want: Fighter Schedule or Bomber Schedule. 

**2. ** Start on the "Sorties" tab and select which sorties you want to appear on the schedule: **A. ** Select the date range and whether you want times displayed in Local or Zulu. Locations with no Zulu Rule or DST Offset entered in the PEX Locations module will also display in Zulu only. 

**B. ** Select the squadron\(s\) from which you want sorties. Select the MDS\(s\) you want to appear. Pick whether you want Alert, TDY, Cancelled, and/or Spare sorties to appear. \(Alert, TDY, and Cancelled are set in the Mission Board in the Missions grid. Spare sorties are created by including "sp" 

anywhere in the Mission Board Line Number field, e.g., "601sp".\) **C. ** Select "Show Only Actual Sorties" to get an after-action report of what actually flew \(sorties with Actual Takeoff and Land times entered on the Mission Board\) in actual takeoff order. 

**D. ** Select "BASH Window" to display the Bird-Aircraft Strike Hazard window of time. This window is setup in the Squadrons module. 

**E. ** Final y, in the "Display" area, pick the columns you want to appear on the schedule. 

**3. ** Move on to the "Ground" tab and select what ground scheduling data \(Personnel Commitments\) you want to appear. 

**A. ** In the "Show" area, select whether to even display the "Ground" data at al and whether to label the entire schedule as "SECRET." 

**B. ** Select the squadron\(s\) from which you want personnel commitments to appear. 

**C. ** Final y, select the supervisor types and commitment types you want to appear. 

**4. ** Select "PDF" to get an Adobe Acrobat read-only type file or "Excel" to get Microsoft editable file. 

**5. ** Your selections for each schedule \(e.g., Fighter or Bomber\) are saved as user preferences. 

**6. ** Times. "\(L\)" times on the schedule are local times at the location specified, e.g., landing at KHIF at 09:00 \( L\) is Hill AFB local time. Ground events and the supervisor schedule display the local time of the user logged in based on their location. The celestial data \( L\) time is also the local time of the PEX user logged in. User locations are set in the Users and Permissions module. 

**7. ** Changes in Red. The schedule can show in red, data that has changed since the schedule was committed. To setup this feature, go to the Mission Board, Tools, Options, Squadron Preferences tab, 158 

and select the items to track \(show in red\) if changed. Later, commit the schedule as normal. If any tracked item changes after the commit, it will show in red on the schedule. Certain calculated values \(i.e., Pattern Time and AR Track Duration\) will never show red, even if they changed. Neither will the following values show in red: Actual Takeoff Time, Actual Land Time, and a person's Weather Category \("WX"\). 

**8. ** Air Refueling \(AR\) Data. PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events: ARIP, ARET, ARCP, ARCT, AREX, AREXIT, and ARINFO. If it finds any of them, they wil appear on the schedule. AREX or AREXIT defines the end of a sequence of AR events, e.g., ARIP, ARCP, and AREX would define a single AR 

sequence. Within an AR sequence, the first supporting data entered against any of the AR events wil show up on the schedule. For example, if you load some of the AR data \(Seq \#, Alt, Rz Type, for example\) on the ARIP line and the rest \(Onload, Priority, for example\) on the ARCP line, that will work fine. If you load the same type of data, e.g., Seq \#, on two different lines within the same sequence, the schedule will print only the first one. For example, if you enter Sequence Number "1201" on the ARIP line and 

"1502" on the ARCP line; it's the "1201" that wil show up. Bottom-line, enter the supporting data on any line of the AR sequence but only once. AR track duration is calculated as the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the AREX sortie events. 

Reverse Track. Define a Reverse AR track in PEX by checking the ”Reverse Track” box on the first ”AREX” 

sortie event. PEX will then disregard the second AREX and ARCP times and use the final ARIP time as real AREX time. PEX assumes a reverse AR track has the fol owing sortie events sequence: ARIP, ARCP, AREX, AREX, ARCP, and ARIP. AR Track duration is the time between the ARCP/ARCT and the final AREX \(which is really the geographic ARIP\). 

**9. ** Airspace and Range Data. The flying schedules \(except Custom Schedule\) provide options to show airspace/range Name, Entry Time, IP \(Initial Point\) Time, and/or Exit Time. 

**A. ** If you use the Sortie Events Builder tab to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX looks for the following Mission Board Sortie Events to populate the following airspace/range data: **1\)** Entry time: "LL EP", "Area Entry", and "ALTN EP" 

**2\)** IP time: "IP" \(but will display only if followed by LL EX, Area Exit, or ALTN EX\) **3\)** Exit time: "LL EX", "Area Exit", and "ALTN EX" 

**NOTE:** If the Entry, IP, and Exit locations are the same \(e.g., IR 275\), PEX wil list the times on one line. If the locations are different \(e.g., IR 175 PtA, IR 175 IP, and IR 175 PtZ\), PEX will list the times on separate lines. 

**B. ** If you use the Mission Builder tab, Sorties grid, Airspace columns to schedule your airspace/ranges, PEX include whatever you schedule for airspace/range Start Time and End Time. 

**C. ** If you use the Custom Schedule report, the airspace process is simpler and more generic. Any PEX Sortie Event or Airspace that you schedule between the Takeoff and Land times, that has a Location Name specified, wil show up on the report when you select Location, Airspace Entry, or Airspace Exit. Exit/End Time is based on Sortie Event Duration or Airspace End Time. 

**10. ** Miscellaneous. 

**A. ** If "IAF" is entered as a sortie event, the IAF time wil display on the schedule and "Pattern Time" 

wil calculate as the time between the IAF time and Land time. 

**B. ** If ”Bus” is entered as a sortie event, the ”Bus” local time will show up in Remarks. 

**C. ** A cancelled sortie will show up with a gray background and ”CANX” in the Mission Number field. 

159 

Scheduling 

**D. ** Crew will show up in the same order as on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. If the order is not as desired on this report, make the change on the Mission Board/Flying Schedule module. 

**E. ** If a person is assigned a WX Cat \(Personnel> Quals & Certs\), the fighter schedule will display the category in parentheses to the right of the crew position. This applies when the person has a MDS 

qualification matching that scheduled on the sortie. If the MDS is different, the parentheses are empty. 

**11. ** Bomber Schedule New Prototype. PEX 5.12 includes a prototype for an improved flying schedule report. Please send the Help Desk any feedback you have on this prototype. To make maximum use of this report: 

**A. ** In the WinPEX Labels module, at Scheduling – Mission Board – Mission Builder, re-label IFF to IFC, OFP, or Block as desired. Use that field on the Mission Board and it will show up on the schedule. 

**B. ** Enter all your AR data on the ARCP sortie event line.

Scheduling 

**Scheduler **

**Scheduler Basics **

**Overview **

The Scheduler module is in development to replace many of the existing scheduling modules, in order to achieve a single workspace to build schedules. Schedules can be generated for Missions, Production Request or Events. Currently, data you input into the Scheduler module does not feed into any other part of PEX 

\(e.g., the My Page, Long Range Scheduler module, Shift Schedule or Commitments Board\), it does however communicate with the Go/NoGo module. 

**Permissions **

■ PEX Administrator and Scheduling Administrator: can build/edit/delete Missions, Events, Production Requests, and can work with ful access within the module. 

■ Scheduler Read Only: al ows users to view the schedule only. 

**Module Notes **

The Scheduler module is only accessible in ePEX. 

To add a location in Scheduler, the location must be established within PEX via the Locations module.

Scheduling 





**Terms **

These apply to terms found in the Scheduler module. 

**Draft**. Draft entries are only visible for users with Scheduling Admin rights to the entry’s owning squadron. 

Users with Scheduling Admin rights can set scheduling entries to Publish for the squadrons to which they have Scheduling Admin rights. Scheduling Admins can Publish the events or the events and their resources. 

Published entries are then also viewable by Users with Scheduling Read Only rights the entry’s owning squadron. 

**Event**. A block of time defined by a start date/time and an end date/time, or al -day. Delivered events can be categorized as Events, Missions, or Production Requests, or they can be user-defined. 

**Event** **Group**. A collection of events. You can apply changes to all member events of the group by changing them in one central place. Changes to individual member events are still possible. 

**Group** **Events**. When enabled, scheduling entries are grouped by Production Requests, Missions, and Events on the Calendar View and ordered by start time within in each grouping. All-day events are grouped at the top of the display and ordered by start time. 

**Issue**. A condition that may impede an event. Issues include NoGo items \(e.g., DNIF or overdue training\), overlapping events \(conflicts\), and mismatched roles and resources. 

**Mission Planning Sheet**. Used primarily by the DCGS community, a Mission Planning Sheet can be generated for any Production Request, Mission, or Event. The Mission Planning Sheet menu item is then visible in the menu for any selected scheduled Production Request, Mission, or Event. 

**Production Request**. 

164 

**Publish Mode**. When enabled, sets new entries to Draft. 

**Resource**. An item, person, place or thing, that can be added to a scheduled event, individual y or in groups. 

Resource examples are people, aircraft tail numbers, airspace, silos and workstations.

**Display a Mission/Event/Production Request in Hierarchy mode **

The Hierarchy view is organized into a tree-like structure and can be used on Mission, Events or Production Requests. The hierarchy view uses “Parent/Child” relational records. The relationship of an event \(parent\), mandates that each child \(sub event\), has only one parent record; whereas a parent record can have one or more child records. This view is helpful to keep track of “parent” events that have multiple “child” events or sub-events and the resources assigned to the event which can be people, aircraft or a resource template.

In the Scheduler, you will create the Mission first then add Sorties to it. In the Scheduler module, Sorties are listed in Sub Events. 

**CAUTION: ** Unlike the PEX Mission Board, the scheduler module has no logic to keep the Sorties and Missions synchronized. With this Scheduler module it is not recommended to build Sorties completely outside the date range of the Mission. You should manual y synchronize the Mission Start Date/Time with the first Sortie’s Takeoff Date/Time. The Mission End Date/Time should be kept manually synchronized with the last Sortie’s Land Date/Time. Not doing so wil make your schedule difficult to understand.

**Training **

**Continuation Training **

**Continuation Training Basics **

**Introduction **

The Continuation Training module allows Training Managers to track personnel’s assigned continuation training requirements for an established training cycle. It is set up so that training assignments can be done via an Aviation Resource Management System \(ARMS\) training import, HQ 

CT file import, and/or by manually assigning PEX generated Unit-Level Training tasks to personnel. 

**Permissions **

**New in 5.16.1 **A new role of ARMS Import/Export is added, and Training Auditor/ARMS is renamed to Training Auditor. 

Several permission roles can access the Continuation Training module and perform administrative functions, in addition to PEX Admin and Administrator. The pseudo-role Supervisor also has limited functions in the CT module, and any Basic User can access the module for the purpose of submitting Training Accomplishment Reports \(TARs\) via the Reporting tab: 

■ ARMS Import/Export is required to access the ARMS tab. This role cannot be assigned to a Joint Use account, i.e., the user must be associated to a Personnel record. 

■ Training Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs and access the ARMS tab. 

■ Training CT Administrator can perform any function in the CT module except audit TARs, setup and use the TACTICS tab, and access the ARMS tab. 

■ Training Auditor \(previously Training Auditor/ARMS\) can audit TARs for both unit-level and ARMS tasks, import and export ARMS data, as well as view Training Tasks and Overview tabs. 

It cannot access the ARMS tab. 

■ Basic User can access and use the Training Tasks tab within the module, as well as submit TARs for squadron personnel via the Reporting tab. 

■ Supervisor is a pseudo-role which is assigned in the Personnel module. In addition to the functions of Basic Users, individuals assigned as a supervisor can also the access the CT tab of their supervisees’ training folders from which they can view subordinate’s CT status, generate daily and monthly TAR reports and view the status of tasks reported but not yet updated in PEX displays. If the unit has set up the CT module to allow it, supervisors may also audit TARs of their supervisees from within the training folder. 

**Module Notes **

The CT module interfaces with and uses data from the Personnel module. For ARMS tasks, the ARMS 

Personnel imports add/overwrite the necessary Personnel data. For unit-level tasks, both local and HQ, units must ensure the fol owing is completed: 

187

**PEX - ARMS Interface **

**PEX-ARMS Interface Overview **

**Overview **

**New in PEX 5.16.1. **PEX now includes connectivity to ARMS via Web Services. This allows users to easily exchange data between ARMS and PEX without using the process of importing data using ARMS-generated CSV files and exporting data using ODAC. This CSV/Virtual Account process remains in place, but has been updated. 

The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS to send data from ARMS to PEX, and PEX to ARMS. 

There are two interface **functions**. 

**1. ** Send validated personnel, personnel flying hours, and training data from ARMS to PEX. 

**2. ** Send audited training accomplishments and AFTO 781 data from PEX to ARMS. 

There are two interface **methods**. 

**1. ** **CSV/Virtual Account**. This is the legacy method used in previous versions of PEX. 

**A. ** CSV. Export data from ARMS into a CSV file, then manually import the file into PEX. 

**B. ** Virtual Account. Export the data from PEX to ARMS using a virtual account. Due to the USAF requirement for two-factor authentication, this option may sunset, or become unavailable, in the near future. If Virtual Accounts are unavailable export data using Web Services described next. 

**2. ** **Web Services**. Establish a direct connection/interface between PEX and ARMS. Once configured, the import and export are respectively accomplished by simply clicking the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons. 

Although the CSV/Virtual Account process remains essentially the same, both the interface and permission roles have been revised. Persons using the CSV/Virtual Account method should thoroughly review this topic before attempting import or export. 

The PEX CSV/Virtual Account and Web Services imports for Personnel and Training behave differently. With the CSV/Virtual Account method, Personnel and Training CSV imports are a complete download from ARMS every time. PEX “wipes” and replaces person training assignments data on every import. ARMS Web Services, on the other hand, only import Personnel and Training records which have been updated in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. For example; Personnel - Import records updated in ARMS since \(date\) Z. 

**NOTE**: ARMS Web Services returns all squadron personnel in each Training import, as ARMS 

refreshes daily to Military Personnel Data System \(MILPDS\) data. As a result, each Web Services Training import into PEX updates all persons' Aviation Service data in Personnel and Z-004 ASC Term Date. 

189 

!(images/000063.png)

Training 

Users using the Web Services method must configure the CSV/Virtual Account method as well. The CSV/Virtual Account method is used: 

■ When a squadron is starting to use PEX for the first time. 

■ For the first training import at the start of each training cycle. 

■ For the first training import after migration to 5.16.1. 

**Permissions **

■ **ARMS Import/Export** is a new permission role. This role allows access to the Continuation Training > ARMS tab and the Import, Export, and Setup buttons. Therefore, this applies to both CSV/Virtual Account method and new Web Services method 

■ **Training Auditor** is the renamed Auditor/ARMS role. Functionality remains unchanged. 

**NOTE**: Both ARMS Import/Export and Training Auditor roles are required in order to export or import ARMS data. For security reasons, the Administrator role alone does not give the ability to import or export ARMS data. 





**Rules **

■ Users using only the CSV/Virtual Account method can disregard the Web Services specific information. 

■ Users can choose an override method when actually importing and exporting \(from the Begin Import and Begin Export buttons\). It is recommended users choose the default method they will routinely use, then override as required. 

■ Users using either the CSV/Virtual Account or Web Services method must have both ARMS 

Import/Export and Training Auditor permissions as described above. 

■ In 5.16.1 migration, PEX automatically sets squadron methods to CSV Imports and ODAC 

Exports. 

■ Persons' Personnel > Qual data is not inserted or updated via Web Services.

**Setup - Configure the PEX-ARMS Interface **

**New in PEX 5.16.1. **

**Web Services Network Setup Interface **

Web services utilizes Machine-to-Machine \(M2M\) Authentication, which requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for the PEX Service Host \(PSH\) server. The ARMS Program Management Office requires certificate information in the form of a Thumbprint for each PSH 

server. Here, the term "PSH Admin" refers to the local person or persons who administer the PEX 

Service Host. Typically, this is the local PEX Administrator in conjunction with the local communications squadron. 

192 

**1. ** The PSH Admin: 

**A. ** Coordinates with the PEX Help Desk to send them: **1\)** Required server certificate information. 

**2\)** HARM codes associated with that certificate. 

**B. ** Works with one HARM office from each PEX database and provides the HARM office with a certificate Thumbprint specific to their PSH. 

**2. ** The designated HARM office for the PEX database: 

**A. ** Enters the certificate Thumbprint in the Continuation Training > ARMS tab > Settings page. The Thumbprint has to be entered only once for the database. The Thumbprint is then visible to, and used by, every squadron in the database. 

**CAUTION: This value is used by al squadrons in the database. Changes should be made with care** **as they affect al units in the database. **

**Setup the import from ARMS to PEX **

**NOTE**: A CSV Training import is required for initial use, even if you plan to use Web Services on a daily basis. 

Adhoc View/Reports will be in Jaspersoft and accessible to all ARMS users worldwide. Users will access these reports to generate the three.csv files: Personnel, Training, and 7-30-60-90 Personnel Flight Hours. Users must schedule the reports in ARMS. 

Go to Training > Continuation > ARMS tab > Settings button. Select a squadron from the Squadron 

& ARMS Unit Identifiers dropdown. 

Associate PEX Squadrons to ARMS Unit Identifiers 

**1. ** Add \(type or paste\) the 17-character ARMS Unit Identifier \(e.g., 0203ARSSQ00000000\) and click Add. This identifier can be found on the Personnel.CSV file in cell A2. 

**2. ** Add \(type or paste\) the 9-character ARMS Unit Identifier \(e.g., 0203ARSSQ\) and click Add. 

This identifier can be found on the 7/30/60/90.CSV file. 

**3. ** To disassociate an ARMS unit, select the unit identifier and click Remove. 

Enter ARMS Data 

781 Data. These can be found on existing AFTO 781s.

**3. ** Add your Issuing Unit. 

**4. ** Click Save. 

Do not include on Training Import 

PEX generates training tasks for four ARMS requirements which are not tracked by ARMS as training events: Z-001 Physical Exam, Z-002 Altitude Chamber, Z-003 Records Review, and Z-004 ASC Termination Date. If your unit does not use one or more of these \(for example, an ICBM unit that does not require periodic Altitude Chamber training\), check the item’s box to exclude PEX from generating it during the ARMS import and click Save. 

193 

Training 

Do Not Overwrite on Personnel Import

**NOTES**: If you do not have a Thumbprint, see the Web Services Network Setup Interface paragraph at the beginning of this topic. 

**Setup the Virtual Account export from PEX to ARMS **

To transfer data from PEX tp ARMS, users must have the fol owing setup. 

■ A virtual account for ARMS. 

■ ODAC downloaded and instal ed on the machine. 

■ Firewall Exemption Letter. Allow network traffic from the machine \(origination\) being used for ARMS export and the destination IP address of the ARMS database. The exchange occurs via bi-directional mode through Port 1521. The instructions for this is not included in this document. You wil need to contact your network administrator to make this happen. 

■ PEX Installed. 

■ User must know how to report and audit training and 781 hours in PEX, then export the data to ARMS. 

Virtual Account for ARMS 

**1. ** In order to export data from PEX to ARMS, the ARMS User must have an ARMS Virtual Account User Name and Password. This is not the same as the ARMS account used to connect to ARMS. An ARMS Administrator can create these accounts in ARMS at System > Security > ARMS External Accounts. 

**2. ** The virtual account is set to “T” for True. A User ID is created along with a Password. The IRA Number used is 11. 

**3. ** In PEX, the same account user name and password from Step 2 above is what you wil enter in: Training > Continuation > ARMS tab > Export > Virtual Account User Name and Password.

**Import ARMS data to PEX **

**New in PEX 5.16.1. **

If using the CSV/Virtual Account method, first export the data from ARMS as an Excel worksheet \(XLS\), and then save it as a CSV file to an accessible location on a computer or network. 

**1. ** Go to Training > Continuation > ARMS tab > Import button. 

**2. ** Under **Squadrons \[Default Setting\]**, select the squadron\(s\) whose data is to be imported. 

Each squadron displays, in brackets, the default method selected in the ARMS tab > Settings. 

You can override these below. 

**3. ** Under **Data Types**, select the type of data \(All, Personnel, Training, and/or Personnel Flying Hours\) to import. 

**4. ** Under **Import Selected Squadrons Using**, select: **A. ** **Each Squadron's default settings**. This will import via CSV file or Web Services as selected above. 

**B. ** **Web services for al **. This will import via Web Services regardless of the Default Setting above. 

197 

Training 

**C. ** **CSV files for all**. This will import via CSV files regardless of the Default Setting above. 

**5. ** Click **Begin Import**. 

**A. ** For squadrons importing via Web Services, the Web Service Imports window will open. 

**1\)** Web Service imports require the Zulu Dates of the last successful imports of Personnel and Training records. 

□ ARMS Web Services only import Personnel and Training records which have been changed in ARMS since the Zulu date specified in the Web Service Imports dialog. 

□ Blank dates indicate the squadron has not yet completed a Web Services import for that data type \(Personnel or Training\). To ensure a squadron's first web service import includes all records changed in ARMS since the squadron's last CSV import, refer to the log file for the squadron's last successful CSV import for each data type. 

At the top of each log file locate the "Data Downloaded from ARMS" date. This is the date/time of the last ARMS import. 

□ If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.1 or later, the date/time is in Zulu. 

You can enter that date as it is. 

□ If the last import was completed in PEX v5.16.0 or earlier, the date/time is in Local time. You must first convert that Local date/time to Zulu date/time, then enter the converted Zulu Date. 

□ Once Personnel or Training updates have been imported via ARMS Web Services, these fields default to the Zulu date of the squadron's last successful Web Services import for that data type. You may change it to a date before the default but NOT after. 

**NOTE**: Because ARMS gets a MILPDS update daily, Personnel records are updated in ARMS daily. Therefore all Personnel records will import with every Web Services Personnel and Training import. 

**B. ** For squadrons importing via CSV files, the CSV Imports window will open. 

**1\)** For each squadron, browse to the CSV file location and select the file. 

**2\)** Click Import. 

**6. ** View the import Log Files: 

**A. ** Select a Start Date and End Date. 

**B. ** Click Go. 

**C. ** Click on the file name and a window will open with the log file details. 

**D. ** To view a list of old log files, select a Start Date and End Date and click Go. 

**E. ** The log lists: 

**1\)** The Zulu date/time of the last ARMS data update, of the data imported into PEX, **2\)** The Zulu date/time the import was initiated, and by whom. 

**3\)** A list of all persons whose data was imported. Each person listed will show the number of training events inserted/updated, the number of training events not inserted/updated and the training events not inserted/updated. If nothing is listed under a person, all training for that person imported successfully. 

198 

!(images/000015.png)

**4\)** A list of any errors. 

**NOTES**: 

• ARMS Web Services does not provide the data necessary to determine the training event type \(OTO, etc\). For that reason PEX cannot guarantee the accuracy of the training events created during the import. For each inserted training event, the training event type can be verified in Continuation Training. 

• You can import data from multiple ARMS units \(for example from a student squadron\) into a single PEX squadron. 

• The import phase of the scheduled activity does not initiate until after the entire export has been received and acknowledged by ARMS, as the unit SARMs need to know that everything they sent from PEX was received and processed by ARMS before PEX begins taking an export from ARMS. This ensures that PEX and ARMS data for each person is always in synch/agreement. It's okay if the export is rejected or failed for a particular person, as the SARM gets a report in the PEX log listing which persons' exports failed. This allows the SARM 

to know why PEX shows one thing but ARMS shows another for an individual person.

**Setup CT **

**Configure RAP **

**Introduction **

Your personnel have an Assigned Mission Ready Status, for example CMR \(Combat Mission Ready\) or BMC \(Basic Mission Capable\). Based on their flight, simulator, and training task accomplishments, PEX will calculate an Effective Mission Ready Status. For example, a person’s assigned status may be CMR but due to a low sortie count, the effective status could be BMC. Once setup, the Effective Mission Ready Status is viewable on the Letter of X and the Go/No-Go pages in PEX. 

For each person using Ready Aircrew Program \(RAP\), first go to the Personnel module and set their mission ready status to CMR or BMC, and their experience indicator to E or I. 

**RAP Requirements **

**1. ** Navigate to Training > Continuation > Setup tab > RAP Requirements. 

**2. ** Select a squadron. 

**3. ** Select: 

**A. ** **ARMS **to base your RAP calculation on ARMS RAP task identifiers. 

**B. ** **Unit** **Level** to base your RAP calculation on Unit Level RAP task identifiers. Using Unit Level RAP will have no effect on RAP probation or Mission Readiness Status if your squadron has enabled Sortie RAP for MRS calculations. 

**C. ** **Neither** to not preform RAP calculations. 

**4. ** Select a data line by CP/MDS/Service Status. 

**5. ** Enter your Task code \(e.g., TOT RAP SRTY, SR001\). 

**A. ** ARMS: In the Task ID field, enter the Task ID as free-text. 

**B. ** Unit Level: In the Unit Tasks field, click Choose, and select the appropriate task from the dropdown, and OK. 

**6. ** From your RAP Tasking Message \(RTM\), enter your look back numbers for Total RAP, 3-Month, and 1-Month Look Back for that specific CP/MDS/Service Status combination for each of the BMC/CMR Experienced/Inexperienced categories. 

**7. ** If the same RAP numbers apply to another CP/MDS/Service combination, copy it over: **A. ** Select the data line with CP/MDS/Service Status you want to copy. 

**B. ** Right-click and select Copy RAP Requirements or Unit Level Requirements. 

202 

**C. ** When the dialog opens, select the CP/MDS/Service you want to copy to by checking the left-hand box. 

**D. ** Click OK. 

**SIM RAP/MSN Rdy **

Setup Simulator \(SIM\) RAP 

**1. ** Select a squadron, MDS, crew position, service, and mission ready status. 

**2. ** Click Load. 

**3. ** Under the SIM Rules header, click the Select Task button to open the Select Task dialog. 

**4. ** Type in or scrol to the task you use for SIM RAP and select it. 

**5. ** Click OK. This will close the dialog and display the selected task to the left of the select task button. You’l also receive a message stating the same task wil be used for the other mission ready statuses for this squadron, MDS, crew position, service status combination. 

**6. ** SIM Required wil be selected by default. If SIMs are optional and could be used to count toward your Flight RAP, select SIM Optional, skip step 8, and continue at step 9. If SIMs are required, enter the total SIMs per training cycle, 3-Month Look back \(SIMs\) and 1-Month Look back \(SIMs\) per your RTM. 

Required SIMs 

Under the required SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are five possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. If you select the TDY Proration rule, you wil enter the personnel TDY days on the RAP O&M TDY page \(described below\). An explanation of each rule fol ows: 

■ **Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 1-month requirement**. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for the 1-month requirement. 

For example, a person has a one-month flight RAP requirement of 9 and a one-month SIM RAP 

requirement of 3. The rule is checked and a value of 1 flight has been entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. This person would not have met their one month SIM RAP requirements since only 1 actual RAP SIM was accomplished and only 1 of the excess 3 RAP flights could be counted as a SIM. 

■ **Max number of excess RAP flights counted as SIMs for 3-month look back**. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP flights that can substitute for a RAP SIM, for 3-month look back. 

For example, a person has the following flight/SIM RAP requirements: one-month flight 9, three-month flight 27, one-month SIM 3, and three-month SIM 9. The rule is checked and a value of 4 is entered. The person has 12 flights one month and 30 for 3 months. The person has 2 SIMs for one month and 7 SIMs for three months. In this case, the person did not meet one-month SIM RAP requirements, but did make the three-month requirement because two excess RAP counting flights could be substituted for the 2 RAP SIMs the person was short for three month SIM look back. 

203 

Training 

■ **Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 1 month look back**. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for the 1-month requirement. 

■ **Max number of excess RAP SIMs that can be counted as flights for 3 month look back**. Enter the maximum number of excess RAP SIMs that can substitute for a RAP flight, for 3-month look back. 

■ **Minimum actual SIMs required per month**. The entered value indicates the number of actual RAP SIMs that must be accomplished in a month to retain status. If this rule is used in conjunction with either of the rules above or the TDY Proration rule below, it takes precedence. 

For example, the one-month rule and this rule have been selected with values of 3 and 1 

respectively. The SIM RAP 1 month requirement is 3. The person has 3 excess RAP flights, but no RAP SIMs. This person would not make RAP requirements because they didn’t get at least 1 actual RAP SIM, even though they had enough excess RAP flights to otherwise meet the requirements for 1 month. 

■ **TDY Proration**. For each month: \#X O&M days TDY reduces the SIM requirement by \#X for that month. This rule allows you to prorate RAP SIMs for O&M days spent TDY. Proration can be down to 0, but the previous rule stil takes precedence, so even if you prorate to 0, if you have a requirement to have at least 1 in a month and the person does not get it, they don’t meet the RAP requirement. The O&M TDY days are entered for each individual on the RAP O&M 

TDY page and are entered by month. 

For example, the rule is selected and the values indicate 3 O&M TDY days reduce the SIM 

requirement by 1 for the month. SIM RAP requirement for the month is 3. The person had 5 

days of O&M TDY. The person also accomplished 1 RAP SIM. This person would not make their one-month requirement since the rule would credit them only 1 SIM. If the person had 6 O&M 

TDY days, they would have made their one-month requirement since the rule would credit 2 

RAP SIMs. 

■ **Min number of SIMs required in one month to regain Msn Rdy Status**. This rule is based on the person being in a non-mission ready status and needs to accomplish a set number of actual RAP SIMs to regain status, in addition to the look back numbers. This rule takes precedence over the one and three-month rules. 

For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The one-month requirement is 3 

RAP SIMs and 9 RAP flights. The person was non-mission ready. The one month rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. The person has accomplished 12 RAP flights and 1 RAP SIM. The person is still non-mission ready. Even though they met their flight RAP numbers and the first rule al ows them to meet their SIM RAP numbers, the person didn’t get the two actual RAP 

SIMs that were required to regain status. 

■ Click Save. 

Optional SIMs 

Under the optional SIM RAP requirement numbers, there are two possible rules that may apply to your unit. If a rule applies, check the box to the left of the rule and enter the value for that rule. An explanation of each rule follows: 

**1. ** **Max number of SIMs per training cycle that can be counted as RAP Flight look back**. This could be read as “How many of the first RAP SIMs in the training cycle can count towards using 204 

the rule below - counting RAP SIMs for flights by month.” In other words, once the person accomplishes this many RAP SIMs, no matter when in the training cycle, subsequent RAP SIMs can no longer count towards flights. 

For example, this training cycle rule is checked with a value of 8. The monthly rule below is also checked with a value of RAP flight requirements are 9 flights per month and 27 flights for three-month look back. 

First Month – The person gets 9 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person makes RAP with their flights alone. However, two RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum, even though they weren’t required to make RAP. 

Second Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. The person made RAP based on the combination of RAP flights and RAP SIMs. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, two more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 4 of the 8. 

Third Month - The person gets 6 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person did not make RAP. 

Even though they had a combination that equaled 9, because only 2 of the 3 RAP SIMs count using the rule below. Whether they were used to make RAP or not, three more RAP SIMs are added to his count of 8 maximum. He is up to 7 of the 8. 

Fourth Month - The person gets 7 RAP flights and 2 RAP SIMs. As soon as he did the first RAP 

SIM this month, that hits the 8 maximum. The person did not make RAP. Even though the rule below says two SIMs could be used monthly, the training cycle rule takes precedence and only 1 SIM could count. 

Subsequent Months – No more RAP SIMs could count towards the monthly requirement because the person already hit the 8 maximum. 

The worst case scenario is the person accomplishing all 8 RAP SIMs the first month of the training cycle and not using any towards RAP flights. Since the maximum of 8 were accomplished, no subsequent RAP SIMs in the entire training cycle could be used to count towards meeting future monthly RAP flight requirements. 

**2. ** **Max number of SIMs per month that can be counted as RAP Flight look back**. Enter the maximum number of RAP SIMs per month that can be counted toward flight RAP. 

For example, the rule is selected with a value of 2 entered. Person is required 9 flights for one-month RAP requirement. The person accomplished 7 RAP flights and 3 RAP SIMs. The person would make their one-month flight RAP requirement because 2 of the SIMs would count toward the 2 flights the person was short.

**Guest Personnel in your Database **

Fol ow these steps when a guest shows up to work with your unit and you want their ARMS data to show up in your PEX database and/or you want to export their training data to ARMS. These steps do not apply for transferring AFTO 781 data. 

**NOTE**: Obtain an ARMS External Account in order to access each ARMS database that stores data for a guest flier. 

**1. ** Log into PEX as an administrator. 

206 

**2. ** Go to Setup > Squadrons and add a “Guest Flier” squadron. Log out of PEX and log back in for changes to take effect. 

**3. ** Go to CT > Setup > Unit Cycle. In the Guest Flier squadron, create a Current training cycle to match your ARMS cycle. 

**4. ** Go to CT > ARMS > Settings. In the Guest Flier squadron, associate the ARMS 9- and 17-character unit IDs with the Guest Flier squadron. The 9-character unit ID can be found in the flying hours .CSV file. The 17-character ID in the personnel .CSV file. Repeat this step for each different unit. 

**5. ** Go to CT > ARMS > Import, select the Guest Flier squadron. Select to import Personnel, Training, and Flying Hours. Click the Import button. 

**6. ** Go to Setup > Users & Permissions, and create a permissions template with just the Basic User role to the Guest Flier squadron. Create PEX user accounts for your guest fliers, associating them to their Shortnames in the Guest Flier squadron, and assigning them the Basic User template. Associate their account to their CAC so they can login to PEX. 

**7. ** Go to CT > Worksheet Builder and create TAR worksheets for the guest fliers. 

**ARMS- Configure your PEX-ARMS Interface **

**Introduction **

The ARMS tab is used to setup the PEX interface with ARMS, import ARMS tasks and export ARMS 

tasks. 

ARMS 6.2 delivered a Jaspersoft reports interface. There are two interface functions that PEX - ARMs customers perform in PEX. Specifically: 

Import data from ARMS to PEX 

PEX no longer provides the Oracle Discover \(.dis\) files required to create the three .csv files. Instead, we wil generate Jaspersoft Ad Hoc Views/Reports. These Ad Hoc Views/Reports take the place of the .dis files. These Adhoc View/Reports will be in Jaspersoft and accessible to all ARMS users worldwide. Users will access these reports to generate the three.csv files: Personnel, Training, and 7-30-60-90 Personnel Flight Hours. Users must schedule the reports in ARMS. 

Export data from PEX to ARMS 

There is no change. Users still need to install the ODAC \(Oracle Data Access Components\) in order to push data out of PEX to ARMS. 

**Settings **

**1. ** Associate PEX Squadrons to ARMS Unit Identifiers 

**A. ** Select a squadron. 

**B. ** In the **Add ARMS unit to import into selected PEX squadron** text box: **C. ** Type in \(or paste\) the 17-character ARMS Unit Identifier \(looks like: 0203ARSSQ00000000\) and click Add. This identifier can be found on the Personnel.CSV file in cell A2. 

207 

Training 

**D. ** Type in \(or paste\) the 9-character ARMS Unit Identifier \(looks like: 0203ARSSQ\) and click Add. This identifier can be found on the 7/30/60/90.CSV file. 

**NOTES:** 

• You can import data from multiple ARMS units \(for example from a student squadron\) into a single PEX squadron. 

• To disassociate an ARMS unit, select the unit and click Remove. 

**2. ** Enter AFTO 781 Data 

**A. ** Select a squadron 

**B. ** In the **781 Data** > **HARM Code** text box, type in your HARM Code \(can be found on existing AFTO 781s\). 

**C. ** Fill out the remaining three text boxes with 781 Data \(these can also be found on existing 781s\). 

**D. ** Click Save. 

**3. ** Exclude PEX-generated training tasks during ARMS Imports PEX generates training tasks for four ARMS training requirements that aren’t tracked by ARMS 

as training events: Physical Exam, Altitude Chamber, Records Review, and ASC Termination Date. If your unit does not use one or more of these \(for example, an ICBM unit that does not require periodic Altitude Chamber training\), check the box by that item\(s\) to exclude PEX from generating it during the ARMS import and click Save. 

**4. .CSV File Locations \(WinPEX only\) **

Browse to the path where the .CSV file and click save. 

**Import **

**1. ** Select the squadron\(s\). 

**2. ** Select the type of data \(Personnel, Training, and/or 7/30/60/90 Flying Hours\) to import. 

**3. ** Click Import. 

**4. ** To view the import log files: 

**A. ** Select a Start Date and End Date. 

**B. ** Click Go. 

**C. ** Click on the file name and a window will open with the log file details. 

**ARMS Export – ODAC Setup **

**X. ** Install ODAC and add the tnsnames.ora file on the ePEX web server: **1\)** At the ePEX webserver, fol ow steps 1-14 above \(same steps you did at the SQL 

server\). 

**2\)** Restart PSH. 

**3\)** At the PEX database \(SQL\) server, select Start, All Programs, Find and select PEX 

Service Host, and select “Run As Administrator.” 

**4\)** When PEX Service Host opens, at the General tab, stop services, then restart services. 

**5\)** If your base does not have ePEX and you use only WinPEX, at the ARMS client machines where WinPEX is installed, follow steps 1-14 above and restart the WinPEX 

client machine. 

**Export **

Once you have ODAC setup on your PEX servers and training/AFTO 781 data ready to export, the last step in the PEX-ARMS interface process is for an ARMS administrator to send the data to ARMS. 

**NOTES**: 

■ If you do not already have an ARMS virtual account, navigate to Modules > System > Security 

> ARMS External Accounts, and create your ARMS Virtual Account \(Do not use the % sign in your password\). 

■ PEX uses IRA 11. 

**1. ** Select the Squadron\(s\) from which data is to be exported. 

**2. ** Pick what you want to export: Training and/or AFTO 781 data. 

**3. ** Read the Message box. It will tell you whether there is any data ready to export. If there is data ready, then proceed. 

**4. ** Type in the ARMS Virtual Account User Name and Password. 

**5. ** Click Export. Al approved records since the last export are then sent electronical y to the ARMS database. 

**6. ** Once the export is complete, a log file is generated and listed in the Log File grid. To view a log file, double-click on the file name. To view a list of old log files, select a Start Date and End Date and click Go.

Priority 1 tasks are usually reserved for tasks that require supervision if overdue. Priority 1 tasks should not be dual categorized as No-Go. 

212 

**5. ** **Task Group**: Use Task Group to group training tasks. 

**6. ** **MDS**: Select the MDS to associate the task to. If it applies to multiple MDS’s in your squadron, select Al . 

**7. ** **CP**: Select the CP to associate the task to. If it applies to multiple CP’s in your squadron, select All. 

**NOTE**: Associating tasks to a MDS/CP impact the following areas/functions: Include in Check Assigned and the Training Go No-Go ball for No-Go tasks. 

**8. ** **Type**: The four types are Currency, Proficiency, Currency/Proficiency, or One-Time. 

• **Currency** tasks must be done at regular intervals defined by the task, e.g., once every 30 

days. 

• **Proficiency** tasks must be done a certain number of times within a training cycle, e.g., 10 

times between 1 January 16 and 31 December 16. The No-Go checkbox is disabled for proficiency tasks because they do not have due dates. 

• **Currency/Proficiency** tasks have a number that must be done by the end of the training cycle and also must be completed within periodic intervals. 

• **One-Time** tasks must be done once, ever. 

**9. ** Currency and Currency/Proficiency Tasks require a Frequency and Number, how often the task must be done: 

• **Days**: The task is due in a specified number of days. 

• **Weekly**. The task is due in a specified number of weeks, at the end of the week. 

• **Months**: The task is due in a specified number of months, on the same numbered day it was accomplished. 

• **Monthly**: The task is due in a specified number of months, at the end of the month. 

• **Quarterly**: The task is due in a specified number of quarters, at the end of the quarter. 

Quarters are Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, and Oct- Dec. 

• **Semi-Annual y**: The task is due in a specified number of halves, at the end of the half. 

Halves are Jan-Jun and Jul-Dec. 

• **Years**: The task is due in a specified number of years, on the same date it was accomplished. 

• **Annual y \(CY\)**: The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the calendar year, 31 December. 

• **Annual y \(FY\)**: The task is due in a specified number of years, at the end of the fiscal year, 30 September. 

• **Birth Month**: The task is due annual y on the last day of the birth month. 

• **Training Cycle**: The task is due by the end of the training cycle. 

• **Freq \#**. Some frequency types \(Days, Months, Monthly, Years, Annual y \(CY\) and Annual y \(FY\)\) require you enter a number too. In other words, how many days, months, or years. E.g., a Years task with a Freq \# of 5, means it must be done every five years. A task accomplished 213 

Training 

on 3 Jan 2016 would be due on 3 Jan 2021. A Weekly frequency requires a day of the week be specified and Birth Month al ows you to specify additional months beyond the Birth Month. 

• **Prof \#**: The number of times the task must be accomplished during the training cycle. It is required only for Proficiency and Currency/Proficiency tasks. 

**10. ** **Currency Warning Days**. Specifying warning days allows you to identify, by task, when you want tasks to be highlighted when they are approaching overdue status. Long warning wil highlight a task in Yellow. Short warning will highlight a task in Pink. E.g., you enter 30 days for Long warning and 5 days for short warning; when the task is within 30 days of going overdue, it will go yellow; when within 5 days, Pink. Tasks will always go red when actually overdue. 

Defaults to 60 days and 30 days respectively. 

**11. ** **Program Code**: Examples are PF, PT, etc. You can use unit program codes, similar to ARMS 

program codes, to filter unit tasks. You can assign multiple program codes to the same task. If the task is to be mapped to an ADLS task, it must have a program code of ADLS. 

**12. ** **Active**: Used to turn on the task. Inactive tasks wil be hidden throughout the rest of PEX. 

**13. ** **No-Go**: No-Go is locally-determined. Marking a task as No-Go will turn a person's Training No-Go indicator red when the task is overdue. No-Go tasks are usual y reserved for tasks that prevent a person from accomplishing duty, even with supervision, tasks such as Flight Physical or Altitude Chamber. No-Go tasks should not be dual categorized as Priority 1. 

**14. ** **Auditing Required**: When selected, the task will not update the person's training records until approved by the auditor. If not selected, as soon as the person reports accomplishment of the task, the task is considered done, without any supervisory auditing, and the person's training records are updated. 

**15. ** **Enable Manual Override**: When checked, these tasks can be reported \(logged\) from the Go/No-Go page by someone with appropriate supervisor permissions but will show as overwritten \(“doughnut” indicator\) until properly reported. 

**16. ** **Affects BMC**: This checkbox does nothing. It is planned for future use. 

**17. ** **Affects CMR**: This task, if overdue, will affect the person's Combat Mission Ready status and is used on the Check Schedule Report. 

**18. ** **Include in Check Assigned**: when checked, PEX will check to see if all personnel with the same MDS and CP as the tasks and a “qualified” qualification code are assigned this task. 

**19. ** **Remarks**: Free text up to 255 characters that will show up in the Remarks column of My Page and as a link on the TAR to help personnel fil out the worksheet correctly.

**Temporary PEX/ARMS currency override. ** 

**Overview. ** The ARMS Bypass feature allows PEX users to ignore or bypass ARMS Training Task dates, on the occasion ARMS is down. With the bypass on, PEX will temporarily calculate training due dates within PEX. 

■ Setting the Bypass to "On" will allow the unit to bypass ARMS currency and/or currency/proficiency type training events. It has no effect on proficiency and one-time tasks. 

Bypass means the unit will use PEX to manually calculate due dates for specific training events based off of a person's last recorded accomplished date. 

■ Setting the Bypass to "Off" with no ARMS training file import, means accomplished and due dates in PEX will not be updated until the next ARMS file import, even when logged and audited. 

**Roles: **

■ Training/Auditor ARMS and Squadron Administrator can turn this feature on or off. 

■ All other roles will be able to see banners throughout PEX in those areas where ARMS Training Events are displayed. 

**CAUTION:** The Bypass feature is a back-up for the selected squadron when ARMS is down. It al ows users to overwrite Currency training event dates until ARMS is back online. Users must have source documents for overwriting dates. Bypass is turned off when an ARMS import is done and/or a user turns it off. ARMS is the true source for all training information; PEX is not a replacement system. 



■ Set the ARMS Bypass to On. 

**1. ** Go to Training > Continuation > Setup > ARMS Tasks > Squadron. 

**2. ** The ARMS Bypass control and status indicator is located at top right. 

**3. ** Click On, and the ARMS Bypass dialog opens. 

■ **Set bypass frequency days for individual training tasks**. 

**1. ** Select the Bypass ARMS radio button. 

217

■ **Set bypass frequency days for al training tasks. ** 

**1. ** Select the Bypass and set Frequency Number in Days for all assigned Currency Tasks radio button. 

**2. ** Set Frequency Number in Days as desired. 

**3. ** Click Save, the dialog closes, and you are returned to the ARMS Tasks page. 

**4. ** Go to the new Bypass Frequency Number in Days column. 

**5. ** For al tasks, note the number of days set as entered in the previous step. 

■ Set the ARMS Bypass to Off. 

**1. ** Go to Training > Continuation > Setup > ARMS Tasks > Squadron. 

**2. ** The ARMS Bypass control and status indicator is located at top right. 

**3. ** Click Off. 

**4. ** Stil on the ARMS Tasks page, go to the new Bypass Frequency Number in Days column. 

**5. ** Note that the number of days previously set remains. On the next ARMS import, these wil reset to the data in ARMS. 

**Bypass indicators. ** With the Bypass set to On: 

■ In Ops > Go/NoGo > TNG, an “A” is superimposed on the training bal s. 

■ A yellow ARMS is Bypassed for the Selected Squadron banner appears in: 

• Displays > My Page 

• Ops > Squadron Daily Schedule 

• Training > Continuation 

• Flying Schedule > Crew Tab 

• Training > Qualification > Folder, Cont Training tab > Continuation Training Tasks **Notes: **

■ Once the Bypass is turned on and the frequency days are set for the Training Tasks, an immediate calculation takes place. 

■ Training Tasks that are marked Priority 1 or No-Go are also included if selected for bypass. 

■ Any training events marked as "Manual Override" will not be considered for Bypass. 

■ Reported Training Tasks must belong to the Current Training Cycle, audited and approved in PEX, in order for the Bypass to calculate the due date. 

■ The Bypass will use the latest approved last accomplished date to calculate a new last accomplished date and due date. 

■ The Bypass feature is turned "Off", when any ARMS .csv import is done in PEX \(Personnel, Training, and or 7/30/60/90 day\). 

■ The Bypass feature can also be turned off, by simply setting the squadron's ARMS Bypass "Off". 

218 

■ The frequency number of days to calculate Bypass due dates can be set from 0 to 2000 days. 

Training events set with a frequency of "0" are not calculated. 

■ The ARMS Bypass feature effects multiple locations in PEX. Users are presented with banners in areas that display ARMS Training Events for a Person. 

**Reporting Completed Training Tasks \(TAR\) **

**Reporting tab **

There are several ways to report training accomplished in PEX. Below is a description of the different ways and recommendation on when to use each for reporting training accomplished. 

■ **Flight Training from Squadron Daily Schedule**: The best way for a person to report flight training is from the Squadron Daily Schedule page. The best practice is to setup this page in auto-refresh mode at Maintenance Debrief and/or the Ops Desk. In the Sortie grid, ensure the TAR column is selected for display. This will show a list of all the people on the sortie. When they get back from a flight, they click on their name, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. 

■ **Flight Training from My Page – TAR **link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the sortie will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. 

■ **Ground Training \(Scheduled\) from My Page – TAR **link: From My Page, in the top commitments section, the ground training will be listed, along with a TAR hyperlink. They can click on the TAR link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. 

■ **Ground Training \(Unscheduled\) from My Page – TAR \(Non MSN\)** link: From My Page, in the top-right area, just below the TEST tab, click on the TAR \(Non MSN\) link, select a TAR, and enter their accomplished tasks. 

■ **Report Training for other people or multiple personnel at one time from CT Module – **

**Reporting** tab: Report training for multiple personnel where many of them logged the same tasks. You can report on one person, then use the Apply to Al Remaining to copy the same accomplishments to the remaining crewmembers. 

**NOTES:** 

■ If a training task does not require auditing, when the Save/Next feature is used, the next record will appear not editable \(it is automatically "approved" since no audit is required\). If the next person needs to make a change from what was saved, a user with administrator permissions can right-click, and in the context menu select Unapprove & Clear Accomplishment, and enter the required data. 

■ If a group is reporting training using the Save/Next feature, and an individual needs to add a training task to their TAR right-click, and in the context menu select Additional Instance to add the required data. 

**Report by Person **

**9. ** The Save/Next button saves the current log entry. If you selected multiple people from the Personnel list, the Save/Next button takes you to the TAR for the next person in line. 

**10. ** To report training tasks quickly when the number accomplished and date accomplished is the same for al personnel: select multiple people from the Personnel grid, update the accomplished volume and date for each task on the first TAR, and click Apply to All Remaining. 

This updates each TAR with the same accomplished volume and date for each task. 

**11. ** When you select Save/Next, if you input an event date outside of your training cycle or if the person was not assigned that task, PEX will generate a descriptive error. 

**12. ** If a task is assigned to a person that line of the report will be white \(editable\) for the Accomplished Volume and Accomplished Date blocks. If the task is not assigned to the individual, that line of the report will be a light gray \(read only\).

**ADLS tab **

The ADLS tab allows you to import ADLS training data with a .CSV file downloaded from ADLS. 

Personnel can log ADLS training accomplished in PEX \(if desired\) and/or continue to import updated ADLS files to update ADLS task completion in PEX. 

**NOTE**: Personnel’s email must match in PEX and ADLS. The SSN match between PEX and ADLS no longer exists. 

**Setup **

**1. ** Add unit level tasks with the program code of "ADLS" to associate to the ADLS import files. 

**NOTE**: If you are currently tracking ADLS tasks in PEX you do not need to add the tasks again. 

Locate those unit level tasks and associate them to the ADLS Program Code. See Setup-

PEX uses the Last Completion date from the file to calculate the Task’s Due Date based upon the currency settings for the Task. For example, if the Task has a currency of 60 days and the file has a Last Completion date of 15 July 2017 then PEX wil calculate the person’s Due Date as 13 Sep 2017. 

227 

Training 

If using PEX to report and audit tasks, and the Accomplished Date reported/audited in PEX differs from that in the ADLS file, the Last Accomplished Date and Due Date in PEX will be overwritten during the import. That is because ADLS is considered the truth source for these tasks. 

View ADLS training task accomplishment and status in the Training Tasks tab.

**Qualification Training **

**Qualification Training Overview **

Qualification training topics are functionally divided between two modules. The topics covered under "Qualification Training" are common between Mission and OJT. Help topics for both Mission 

and OJT follow this overview. 

■ The **Mission** module covers initial and upgrade qualification training in the form of courses. 

■ The **OJT** module covers On-the-Job Training \(OJT\) in the form of Career Field Education and Training Plan \(CFETP\) tasks lists, commonly referred to as AF Form 623a and 797 tasks. 

Each module has a unique home page with their respective functions. Functions common to both Mission and OJT, such as Popular Topics and Overview Rainbow, appear on both home pages. Those links take the user to the same page, regardless of which home page was used. Links on each home page are arranged in a logical workflow order. 

**NOTE:** The separate Mission and OJT modules are only in ePEX. WinPEX retains the legacy Qualification module. 

Mission and OJT homepages are presented below. 

■ Functions common to both Mission and OJT are boxed in green. 

■ New functions are boxed in orange.

**Mission **

**Mission Training \(Courses\) Overview **

**Introduction **

The Mission training module is used to manage upgrade training. This upgrade training can take the form of short in-unit upgrades and formal schoolhouse upgrades. Before you can utilize Mission training, you must configure several Setup features to your unit’s specifications. This includes adding Grade Sets, creating Training Tasks that wil be used for your courses, and setting the number of monthly and quarterly reviews for student’s Grade Folders. 

**Controls **

241 

!(images/000087.jpg)

Training 

Access this module by navigating to Main Menu > Training > Mission. 

**Workspace **





**Setup Mission Training **

Select the Setup Tab in the QT module. 

**Add a Grade Set **

A grade set is all the different grades you will use when evaluating student tasks and Blocks of Instruction \(BOI\). Each MAJCOM uses different grades. A Grade Set is where you tell PEX which grades you are going to use. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Course Grade Sets. 

**2. ** Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. 

**3. ** Right-Click in the Course Grade Sets Canvas and select Add. 

**4. ** Create a Grade Set Name and click on the Canvas to save. 

**5. ** Decide whether your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes: 1\) Task Grades and BOI Grades or 2\) Task Proficiency Levels, Task Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. 

**NOTE**: All Grade Sets require BOI grades. You wil need to know this information in order to decide which Gradesheet form you should select when you are ready to create your course. Selecting the correct Gradesheet form that corresponds to your Grade Set will allow your grades to automatically populate to your chosen form once grading is complete. See Help Topic,  QT - Create Courses for selecting the appropriate Gradesheet forms. 

**6. ** Add grades to the appropriate panel by right-clicking in the specific grid you would like to use. Assign grades/levels with the appropriate ranking \(1 is the highest\). It is imperative you assign the appropriate ranking to all grades/levels in order for the grading feature to work properly in PEX. 

**Task Grade**. These are the grades students can achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

**Task Proficiency Level**. Displays the grades student can achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

242 

**Task Knowledge Level**. Displays the grades student can achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

**BOI Grade**. The grades students can achieve after completing a Block of Instruction. This field is required for all courses. 

**7. ** Select the checkbox for the default grade/level for each panel, if desired. The default grade/level will automatically populate minimum grades for all BOIs and tasks built in the course. PEX will classify any grades above the minimum as satisfying requirements and any grade below the minimum as failing. If you would like to change the default minimum grade for specific BOIs or tasks, you can make this adjustment in the Course Build on the desired BOI\(s\) and task\(s\). See Help Topic, QT - Building Courses.  

**8. ** Other options from this screen include the ability to send a Grade Set to another squadron \(Send To\), delete, print, and export Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels and/or BOI Grades to Excel by right-clicking a specific Grade Set. 

**NOTE**: Once a Grade Set is assigned to a course, you cannot make any revisions to that specific Grade Set. If you need to make revisions to a Grade Set that is being used, create a new Grade Set with a different name. Apply the new Grade Set to your desired course while you are on the Courses page. 

Delete the older/inaccurate Grade Set. Applying a new Grade Set for a course that has already been built will delete all minimum required Task Grades, Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades. You will need to input this information manually into the course BOIs. See Help Topics, QT 

- Create Courses.  

**Add a Task List **

Tasks are the graded items in a BOI. For example, a simulator training event would have numerous tasks, such as “Pre-mission Briefing.” This is where you enter all your tasks for all your courses. 

Adding a master task list before beginning your course build will keep you from duplicating data. A master task list will also help you maintain standardization between courses. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Course Tasks. 

**2. ** Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. 

**3. ** Select Course Tasks. 

**4. ** Right-Click in the Course Tasks Canvas and select Add. 

**5. ** Give the task a unique identifier for the Task Code. Using the same identifier with a different number for all the tasks listed in that course will allow you to easily search for Task Codes during course builds. Be sure to maintain consistency with your naming scheme. For example, “B-52 

EW UPG-01” and “B-52 EW UPG-02”. 

**6. ** Other options available from this screen include the ability to send tasks to another squadron \(Send To\), delete a task, export tasks to Excel, and printing tasks by right-clicking on selected tasks. 

**NOTE**: You can add additional tasks to your master task list. However, if a task has been applied to a course via a BOI, you cannot edit or delete this task from the master Task List until it has been removed from all BOIs. 

**Set Review Options **

243 

Training 

Configuring Review Options allows you to select who can review/certify student folders and how often the reviews are required. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Options. 

**2. ** Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. 

**3. ** You may enter a name for the unit defined tab of the training folder. The default name is 623. 

**4. ** Select the desired number of monthly folder reviews \(0-2\). 

**5. ** Select the desired number of quarterly folder reviews \(0-2\). 

**6. ** Select whether or not you will allow a supervisor to complete a folder review. 

**NOTE:** If you cannot "see" the Supervisor Review option, Click on the Number of Reviewers and hit the TAB key until the option is displayed. 

**7. ** Select the method to populate BOI Reviewer/Certifying information: **Logged in User**. Automatical y populates the unit/name information in the BOI grade sheet with that of the logged-in user. Reviewers cannot be logged into a group account or as PEXAdmin. Reviewers must be logged in as a user. Also select whether or not a Supervisor can Review/Certify. 

**Selectable List**. Allows you to specify unit, then name, of any member in the database. 

**8. ** If a student does not meet the minimum requirements for a BOI, select which tasks the student should repeat. 

**All Tasks**. All tasks from the original BOI will be included in the repeat BOI. 

**Failed/Incomplete Tasks**. Only the failed/Incomplete tasks from the original BOI will be included in the repeat BOI. 

**NOTE**: The Review Options will be applied to all courses in your selected squadron. Review Options are not course specific. 

**Add Gradesheet Reminders **

Gradesheet reminders trigger warnings when Task or BOI grades are graded below minimum. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Options 

**2. ** Select the squadron 

**3. ** Under Gradesheet Reminders, pick which grades you want warnings for: Task Grade, Task Proficiency Level, Task Minimum Knowledge Level, and/or Overall BOI Grade. 

**Create links between BOIs and STS Task lists **

Creating links between BOIs and STS task list provides valuable information to trainers and supervisors. Once the link is established, training on a particular BOI will now have a corresponding STS tied to it and show which STS items are ready to be signed by the trainee. 

**NOTE:** This feature DOES NOT automatically sign off items. Use the Popular Topics FAQ's to retrieve items that need to be signed off. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Link QT BOIs to STS Tasks. 

244 

**2. ** Select the Squadron, the Task List and Skil Level. 

**3. ** Select Add, and the Task List builds on the left. 

**4. ** Under BOIs, select the Course you are going to associate the Task list items to. 

**5. ** Check the Line Item number\(s\) from the left and then the BOI name\(s\) from the right and click Save. 

**Edit existing links between BOIs and STS Task lists **

**1. ** If you need to modify a link, select one group of Task List Tasks and click Edit. 

**2. ** In the resulting Task List Details and BOIs lists, make the appropriate changes and click Save. 

**Add Phases **

Phases can be created to organize your course into distinct sections which define various portions of your course. End of Phase can also be defined in the course to determine if specific event\(s\) requirements have been met 

**1. ** Go to Mission Training Homepage > Setup > Phase Builder > select Squadron > Course name **NOTE:** Course must be a New Course 

**2. ** Click add Phase or right click in white space 

**3. ** Name Phase and select symbol, edit or remove by selecting Phase and right clicking or select Phase and delete 

**4. ** Under Setup > Course Builder > select Course > open each BOI Details and assign the correct Phase, if the BOI is the last in that Phase designate it as End of Phase in the BOI **5. ** Create Phase Requirements under Overview: 

**A. Quantity: Calculated vs. Required fields **

**o** Calculated field is the total number of times that a particular task is expected to be completed according to the Number Required for that one task across all BOIs in the course. Example: If there are 3 BOIs in the phase, and all 3 include the Task “Night Landing” with a Required number of 1 each time, then the Quantity > Calculated field will show 3. 

**o** Required field is the total number of times a student is required to complete that task during that entire phase. 

**B. ** **Grade: Calculated vs. Required Fields** \(Parallel requirements and definitions as for the Quantity fields\) 

**o** Calculated field is the highest required Min Grade that a particular task is set for across all BOIs in the phase. 

**o** Required field is the Min Grade that a student is required to achieve by the End of Phase \(the last BOI in that phase\). 

**6. ** Activate Course 

**Create a Course **

245 

Training 

A Course is a sequence of individual training events. These training events are grouped into Blocks of Instruction \(BOIs\). The BOIs contain individual training tasks. This topic explains how to create the course properties, after which you build the course itself, with BOIs and tasks. 

**NOTE**: Before building a course, contact the PEX Help Desk. Often, we can build the course for you. 

If you want to build the course on your own, first review the help topic, Build a Course.  

**Add a new course **

**1. ** Training > Mission > Overview > Courses 

**2. ** Right-Click the Courses grid and select add. 

**3. ** Required Fields. 

**Course Name**. The name must be unique compared to the other courses listed. 

**Grade Sets**. You cannot create a Course without first creating a Grade Set in the Squadron. See Help Topic, Setup Mission Training.  

**Training Days**. The number of days a course will last. 

**4. ** Optional Fields. 

**Course Number**. Usually listed in the SOI if applicable. 

**Description**. Provides detailed information regarding the course. 

**MDS**. The particular Mission Design Series. When importing a course, a pop-up will appear asking you to select the appropriate MDS for the course. This is the only time you will be able to choose an MDS for an imported course. NOTE: You can select an MDS for a new course only if the MDS is already in the PEX Database. See Help Topic, Aircraft listed under Maintenance. 

**Course Type**. Determines in what tab of the Training Folder this course will be displayed. The default is Qual Training Tab. Unit Defined can be relabeled via Qual Training Setup. 

**Regression**. Used to apply HQ AMC or HQ AFSOC regression rule logic if applicable. Regression rules apply to Task grades, not BOI grades. 

**Forms: Summary, Gradesheet, Comments, Closeout**. Forms are not mandatory but they should be. If you do not select specific forms you will lose functionality you may want to utilize while grading. 

The AF Form 4419 is available as a Closeout form. 

**NOTE**: If your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes Task Grades and BOI Grades, you wil need to select the ACC 206 form on the Courses page. When you select the ACC 206 form, data from the Task Grades and BOI Grades will automatically import into this form once grading is complete. 

**NOTE**: If your MAJCOM/Unit utilizes Proficiency Levels, Knowledge Levels, and BOI Grades, you wil need to select the AF 4024 form on the Courses page. When you select the AF 4024 form, data from the Proficiency Level, Knowledge Level, and BOI Grades will automatically import into this form once grading is complete. 

**NOTE**: Intel Units wil select the AF 4381 Form. 

**5. ** **Limit Instructors. ** Check this box if you want to limit student instructors to only those selected as primary, secondary, and continuity instructors \(not all course instructors\). 

**6. ** Click off the highlighted course to Save. 

246 

**7. ** **Setup Most Common Grades**. You can select up to five of the most commonly used grades for an individual course. This allows quick grading on the gradesheet, while retaining the ability to use all grades in the course gradeset. For example, your course Grade Set uses Task Proficiency Levels 1 through 4, and Task Knowledge Levels A through D. The most common grades are 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3A. 

**A. ** Right-click on the Course row and select Setup Most Common Grades. 

**B. ** When the dialog opens, select and add the most common Task Grades, Task Proficiency Levels, and/or Task Knowledge Levels. 

**C. ** The selected grades appear in the Common Grades Order grid.

**E. ** Grades will appear on the Gradesheet as displayed here. Uncommon grades can still be selected by expanding the Gradesheet. 

**F. ** Click Save or Save & Close. 

**G. ** ** New in 5.16.1. **Courses with customized grades show a checkmark in the Grade Set Is Customized column. 

**H. ** ** New in 5.16.1. **Once saved, you can copy these common grades to other courses, if those courses use the same gradeset. In the same dialog, click Copy To. 

**I. ** When the Copy Common Grades to Courses dialog opens, select the desired courses and click Copy Grades To Course. 

**J. ** Click Save or Save & Close. 

**K. ** When the dialog closes note the Grade Set Is Customized column shows a check for each course utilizing this option. 

**Activate a course **

Courses need to be activated in order to export the QT File and enrol students. Click Activate when building the course is finished. A course cannot be edited when it is listed as Activated. If you are importing a course sent to you, it will be listed as Activated. If an Imported Course needs to be edited, you can Copy as a Local Course. See later section for more information. 

Close enrollment 

To avoid enrolling anymore students into a course, you can close enrollment. Click Close Enrollment under the Active column. Students will not be affected if they are already enrolled in a course that has a Closed Enrollment. If a course with a Closed Enrollment needs to be used again, you can Copy as a Local Course. See later section for more information. 

Import/export courses 

If someone outside your database builds a PEX QT course, they can export it and send it to you for importing. This saves you the time of building it from scratch. 

Import 

Importing a course into PEX will also add the Grade Set and Tasks within the course. Once a course is imported, it will be listed as an Activated course. 

**1. ** Right-Click on the Courses Canvas. 

247

**1. ** Right-Click selected course. The Course wil be highlighted as yellow when selected. 

**2. ** Make sure the course is not activated. 

**3. ** Selected Create New Version. 

**4. ** A New Version of the Course wil appear with a new Version number listed. 

248 

**5. ** A Course can only Create a New Version once. 

**NOTE**: If you would like to edit the Grade Set once a course is built, all of the grades for BOIs and Tasks will disappear. You must manually change every graded Task and BOI within the course to its assigned grade. It is a huge deal to change the Grade Set once the course is built. 

**Delete a course **

**1. ** Right-Click the course that is no longer needed. 

**2. ** Select Delete. 

**3. ** You must keep in mind even though the course is deleted, the Tasks and Grade Set remain. 

Other courses using the same Tasks and Grade Set will not lose any material. 

**NOTE**: You cannot delete a course once a student has been enrol ed. See Help Topic, Managing Courses four further instruction. 

**Build a Course **

**NOTE**: Before building a course, contact the PEX Help Desk. Often, we can build the course for you. 

If you want to build the course on your own, start with the help topic,  Create a Course.  

After you have input your basic course information from the Help Topic, QT – Start Building a Course,  

you may now finish building the details of your course. 

**1. ** Training > Mission > Setup > Course Builder. 

**2. ** Select the squadron from the dropdown menu. 

**3. ** Select the Course Name from the dropdown menu. 

**NOTE:** The course that you created will initially have the name of the course followed by \(NEW\). Once the BOI’s have been added and saved, that will change to \(ACTIVE\). 

**4. ** Add Blocks of Instruction \(BOI\) to the correct training day by clicking the BOI icons and moving them to the appropriate spot on the course build canvas. Every distinct lesson is a BOI. 

For example, ACAG 01 and ACAG 02 would be two different BOIs in PEX, even if the provided documentation has them blocked together on the same day. Do not identify pre-requisites yet. 

You will identify pre-requisites at the very end of building the entire course. The order of multiple BOIs on the same training day is important, for readability. We recommend: **A. ** Flight \(at the top\) 

**B. ** SIM 

**C. ** All others with a pre-req in or out 

**D. ** All stand-alone BOIs \(no pre-req in or out\) 

**5. ** Open the BOI Details by double-clicking on the icon or by right-clicking and selecting Edit Details. BOI Name is a mandatory field. Give the BOI a name. Name each BOI using capital letters, for readability. 

**6. ** If the BOI takes longer than one day to complete, change the \# Days to the correct number. 

**7. ** Tasks are sub-components of the BOIs. While stil in the BOI Details, add tasks by selecting the Tasks tab. Search from your master task file using either the Task Code or the Task Name and select GO. Select the tasks you would like to use by moving them into the Tasks Canvas. If you do not have tasks in your master list, you can also add tasks by selecting Create New Task 249 

Training 

in the BOI Details. Right-Click on the Create New Task Canvas and left click on the Create New Task. Be sure to give your tasks a unique identifier for the task code, but maintain consistency with the naming scheme for all tasks in the course. 

**NOTE:** Information on building a mater task list is provided in the Help Topic, Mission Training 

> Setup. If the BOI is only one thing, e.g., “BEEG 02 – Egress Lab”, it has no Task. Only the BOI is graded overall. If there is only a single graded item in the BOI, the BOI should not have any tasks at all. If a BOI has multiple things that need to be graded, then add a course task for each graded item. 

**8. ** Select the Type of task. This will help in creating a sound structure for your BOI. 

**Header**. The header can be used as a divider between groupings of tasks within a single BOI. If this type of item is selected, the rest of the fields become “locked”. 

**Task**. The actual task that you need to record. 

**Sub** **Task**. Is any task that will be needed to complete an overall task. 

**9. ** Select the Minimum BOI grade, Number Required, Minimum Grade, Minimum Proficiency Level, and Minimum Knowledge Level, if applicable. To make building courses more efficient, the minimums are defaulted to the grade/level you selected in the Grade Set build, see Help Topic, Setup under Mission Training. If you would like to change only a select few minimum grades to a higher or lower level, you may do so in the Edit Details canvas. 

**Minimum BOI Grade. ** The grade students must achieve on a Block of Instruction. 

**Number Required. ** Indicates how many times a student must accomplish a specific task in that specific BOI. 

**Minimum Grade. ** Demonstrates the grade students must achieve on a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

**Minimum Proficiency Level. ** Displays the grade students must achieve when they demonstrate/perform a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

**Minimum Knowledge Level. ** Displays the grade students must achieve when they describe/explain a specific task. This field is not required for all courses. 

**10. ** Add any remarks, if necessary. Select Save. 

**11. ** Repeat this process until all of your BOIs are incorporated into your course. 

**NOTE:** If BOIs have the same tasks, you can copy a BOI to another day by right-clicking on the desired BOI and selecting copy. On another day within the Canvas, right-click and paste. Do not forget to change your BOI name. 

**12. ** Add prerequisites for BOIs and Tasks by double-clicking the BOI icon to open the BOI Details. 

Select the BOIs tab. Open the folders to view tasks, if necessary. Move the selected BOIs and/or tasks to the Prerequisites Canvas. Select Save when you are finished adding all BOI and/or Task prerequisites. 

**13. ** On the Canvas, select Show Prerequisite Lines to ensure prerequisites are input correctly. 

**14. ** Review your course for any errors you may have overlooked during the build. An easy way to review your course material in an accessible format is by generating a Course Details Report. 

See Help Topic, Course Details. 

**15. ** Activate your course after you make any necessary revisions. Training > Mission > Overview 

> Courses. Select Activate. 

250 

**NOTE**: Once you activate a course, you cannot make revisions to that course. To revise, you would need to create a new version of the course and edit the new version. Therefore, you should always review and validate the course before activation. 

The next step 

Once you have activated your course, you may begin enrol ing students. See Help Topic,  Managing 

Courses.  

**NOTE**: Testing your course may also help you check the functionality of your course build. Try enrolling a “fake” student to the activated course and follow the normal procedures for grading material and completing the course. Evaluate whether or not your build yields the results you would like to see.

Training 

**A. ** Date. Before you can grade a BOI you must enter a date. If the date differs from the planned date determined when the student was enrol ed \(with or without using a template\) PEX wil ask you to Edit the BOI Dates, however, once the BOI is graded, the date is harder to revise. The BOI Date can be easily changed before or during the grading process, but once the BOI is graded, the date is harder to revise. Edit the BOI Date, if necessary. There are four options in editing the BOI Dates from the pop up window: 

**o** Change only this BOI to the selected date and al other BOI’s following. 

**o** Change this BOI to the selected day and leave all other BOI’s as is. 

**o** Reflow all BOI’s from the planned date of XXXX, including this BOI, forward by this many training days: Input the amount of days in a \+/- format. 

**o** Apply a new template from this BOI on. 

**NOTE**: If a BOI is listed as Failed \(red\), Passed \(green\), or Not Applicable \(grey\), you will not be able to edit the BOI date. If you need to change the date of a BOI after it has been graded and saved, you wil need to open the BOI Grade Sheet. Then, on the BOI Overal Grade, select the blank entry \(null\) and click Save. This minor change will convert this BOI to an In Progress \(blue\) state. Once In Progress again, you can reopen the BOI Grade Sheet and now edit the date as appropriate. You will also need to reinsert the BOI Overall Grade and select Save.

**FCIF Admin **

**FCIF Admin Basics **

**Introduction **

The Flight Crew Information File \(FCIF\) module provides your unit with a means to disseminate information quickly, usually of a temporary nature. The PEX FCIF Admin module implements the FCIF requirements of AFI11-202V2, and is easily adapted to similar types such as the Intelligence Read File \(IRF\). FCIFs are created and assigned in FCIF Admin by MDS and Crew Position. Users can read, and sign for, FCIFs from FCIF Overview, Go/No-Go, and My Page. Users sign for FCIFs with their PEX Security Identifier. Obsolete FCIFs are rescinded but remain in PEX as such and can be reactivated. After a suitable period FCIFs can be permanently deleted. 

■ **No-Go FCIFs** must be read and acknowledged prior to performing the mission. They appear red on Go/No-Go displays until signed. 

■ **Non No-Go FCIFs** can be read and acknowledged at the user’s convenience. They appear yel ow on Go/No-Go displays until signed. 

**Permissions **

Three permission roles can access the FCIF Admin module, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator. 

**Stan Eval Administrator** and **Stan Eval** Evaluator can perform any function in FCIF Admin. 

**Stan Eval Read Only** can view and print, but cannot add, rescind, delete or edit an FCIF. 

**Rules **

FCIFs are available to all squadrons in a database, meaning: 

■ An individual FCIF number can only be used once in that database. 

■ Changing an FCIF will change it for all squadrons, not just one you are working in. 

**Controls **

Access these procedures by navigating to Stan Eval > Testing Admin. 

**Workspace **

Stan Eval 

**Stan Eval Management **

**SEM Basics **

**Introduction **

The Stan Eval Management \(SEM\) module enables you to administer a comprehensive Standardization and Evaluation program in accordance with Air Force Instructions. You can create, assign, grade, record and track evaluations. Configure PEX for your unit’s stan/eval program, tailored by Squadron, MDS and Crew Position. Exams are managed in Testing Admin and Testing. Evaluation reports are generated in Stan Eval Reports. 

Further SEM guidance is in: 

■ Stan Eval Setup. How to configure PEX for your unit. 

■ Stan Eval Overview. How to manage your Stan Eval program. 

■ Stan Eval Personnel. How to use controls to navigate evaluations and related functions. 

■ Stan Eval Tactics, Techniques and Procedures. How to conduct various evaluations and related functions. 

**Permissions **

Three permission roles can access Management, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: 

■ Stan Eval Administrator can perform any function in SEM. 

■ Stan Eval Examiner is similar but cannot edit settings in Setup. Stan Eval Examiner can however, view, print and change displays in Setup. 

■ Stan Eval Read Only can print and change displays throughout SEM but cannot edit. 

Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Examiners are selected in Preferences > Eval Forms. 

We suggest only persons with training in this module be given Stan Eval Administrator as some actions are difficult if not impossible to reverse. Stan Eval Read Only is intended for staff or HHQ 

inspectors who need only view data. Users not assigned a Stan Eval role can still view their own evaluation folder. 

**Rules **

■ Users cannot grade their own evaluations. 

■ A grayed-out entry indicates it is in use and cannot be edited or deleted. 

■ Entries with gray backgrounds are required by AFI, shipped with the software, and cannot be edited. Unit-added entries can be edited. 

**Module Notes **

■ SEM pulls data from other PEX modules: 

306 

• **Maintenance > ** **Aircraft**. Verify the list the MDSs needed for Stan Eval. Some communities \(e.g., aeromed\) do not use the Series letter. By listing the MD and S characters separately you can control individual preferences in SEM. hyperlink 

• **Setup > ** **Squadrons**. hyperlink 

**o** Installation column, ensure your location is correct for your evaluation forms. 

**o** Display MDS in Dropdowns column, ensure your MDS\(s\) are checked for display. 

• **Setup > ** **Personnel > ** **Personnel** tab. hyperlink **o** Service Status column, identify each person as A - Active Duty, R - Reserve, or G - 

Guard. “A” is the default. 

**o** MDS and CP columns, ensure each person has the correct MDS and CP. If you need to assign or change data, go to the Quals tab. Each person must have at least one MDS/CP 

set as Primary. Additional MDS/CP combinations can be as added as required. 

• **Setup > ** **Users & Permissions**. hyperlink Set permissions as desired. 

■ Evaluation folder import from another PEX database is included as part of personnel data file import in Setup > Personnel. 

**WARNING: PEX al ows you to reopen closed evaluations. This deletes al signatures and revisions** **from the form. We recommend not reopening and closing evaluations completed in an earlier** **version of PEX as this can cause unanticipated results. For example, a person may appear to be** **qualified and current in al parts of SEM except for the Rainbow Unqualified panel list. Creating** **and deleting a SPOT eval on the person may resolve the issue. ** 

**Workspace **

These features are accessed by navigating to Stan Eval > Management. 

307

Stan Eval 



**1. ** **Home**. Central display of all SEM pages. 

**2. ** **Overview**. Stan Eval program management functions, overview of processes and timelines. 

**3. ** **Personnel**. Administer evaluations. 

**4. ** **Setup**. Configure how your squadron will execute Stan/Eval program. 

**5. ** **Search** and Pushpin. Search for people by name. When “pinned” opens SEM to the pinned page. 

■ Throughout SEM you have a choice of executing commands with either menu buttons or a right-click context menu. The fol owing instructions are written around “best practices.” 

• **Save**. Most modules save data when clicking off a line but a few have Save buttons. 

• **Expand**/**Col apse All**. Most SEM pages have a blue, expand-and-collapse-all-grids button at the center/top of the page grids. 

• **User name**. The user names display throughout SEM are links to the person’s Person Details page. 

• SEM uses the “visibility” model to display options. Instead of adding multiple instances of the same item \(e.g., a new eval type\) to a database, a single instance of an item is added and made visible to the squadrons using it. This simplifies moving people between squadrons within a database. You must have SE permission to a squadron in order to view it in Setup. 

308 

• When a person is added to your database from another PEX database via a Personnel Data File import, any Stan/Eval data will be automatically added. Likewise, if a person leaves your database for another, their Personnel Data File will include Stan/Eval data. 

**Setup- Configuring SEM **

■ Overdue or Failed evaluations place personnel in NoGo state \(Red Ball\). In NoGo, persons with overdue or failed evaluations display NoGo/red instead of caution/yellow . 

■ Show personnel with missing qualifications as Caution \(Yellow Ball\). In NoGo, persons with MDS/CP qualifications in Setup > Personnel > Quals and no corresponding qualification in SEM 

will display caution/yellow. 

**NOTE:** If “Overdue or Failed evaluations place personnel in NoGo state” is checked, “Show personnel with missing qualifications” switches from Caution \(Yellow Ball\) to NoGo state \(Red Ball\). 

■ Show qualifications within 30 days of expiration as Caution \(Yellow ball\). In NoGo, persons with qualifications that expire within thirty days will show yellow. If on a wavier, NoGo uses the wavier expiration date. 

■ Use the Failed Requisite Exam preference. Go/No-Go shows No-Go \(red\) or Caution \(yellow\), as selected with the radio buttons, for failed requisite exams. If unchecked, Go/No-Go shows green. 

**CAUTION:** PEX already identifies personnel as NoGo \(red\) if they have a failed a requisite CAPS/Boldface/EPE. If unchecked, there is no indication of failed requisite exams in Go/No-Go. The failed requisite exam does not need to be part of an open evaluation to change the Go/No-Go indicator. For personnel with multiple crew positions, PEX takes into account the MDS and crew position associated with the requisite exam. A successful re-take of the same Type \(including MDS/CP\) requisite exam will restore the Go/No-Go status to green. 

**NOTE:** Entering a passing or failed grade manually on an individual’s Eval Details > Requisites will not affect the No-Go indicator. It the exam is taken on paper, enter it in PEX as an Offline Exam so it feeds No-Go. 

**Periodic Evaluation Expiration **

Enter the number of months for which an evaluation is valid. For a 17-month cycle, enter 18 \(not 17\). This determines the expiration date for this evaluation. 

**Eligibility Zone **

Enter the number of eligibility zone months for periodic evaluations. For aircrew and ISR units, enter 6. 

**Default Eval Form **

Select AF Form 8, 8a, 4350 or 4143. This will be the default for your squadron but can be changed on individual evaluations and on an individual’s Person Details. For aircrew, pick Form 8. For ISR 

units, pick Form 4350. 

**Eval Form Signature Mode **

312 

Select whether you want to use digital \(CAC\) signatures or manual \(pen-and-ink\) signatures on the evaluation form. Digital is preferred. 

**CAUTION:** When switching modes, any evaluation with some but not al signatures wil dump those signatures. In other words, an evaluation form must have all digital or all manual signatures. This does not affect evals with all signatures in place. 

**Display MDS Series Letter **

For example, C-130H. Selecting No will display C-130, selecting Yes will display C-130H. For A2-directed ISR units, pick No unless you are in an F-15E unit. 

**Email Zone Notification Template and Email Late Requisites Template** Edit the default emails sent when people enter their zone or are late on requisites. Use the buttons across the top to enter variables into the email. For ISR units, make the text edits which are directed in the PEX ISR SEM checklist Set up Preferences. 

**Additional Eval Reviews **

Setup a pre- and post- signature form review process. Whatever you enter here will be appended to the Additional Comments on the evaluation form. Pre-signature reviews, up to eight, must be completed before the examiner is allowed to digitally sign the form. The Posted review is activated after the examinee’s signature is on the form. In both cases a Review button activates when appropriate. Clicking Review registers the user account name of the person logged in. This cannot be a joint use account. For example, you are associated to multiple user accounts including yourself and PEXAdmin. If logged in as yourself you can sign off the review. If logged in as PEXAdmin you cannot. 

■ Click Add one and enter the reviewer’s office symbol. To add more, right-click and select Add. 

The order entered will be the order displayed. To edit a reviewer, highlight the record and make the necessary changes. To delete a reviewer, highlight the record, right-click, and select the delete action. 

■ Display Additional Reviewers on Form 8. If not checked, the reviewers display in the GUI but not the eval form. 

■ Require a “Posted” entry. When checked, activates the Post review process. 

■ Do not show evaluation form in Section II of the FEF until the post review action is complete. 

This is not active unless “Require a “Posted”” entry is checked. The link to the evaluation wil still be visible in the Eval Forms/MFR grid on the person details page. 

**Restriction Templates **

Click Add one and add formatted restrictions for the reverse side of eval forms. 

**Assoc Eval Types/Reqs **

This page associates eval types and requisites with individual MDS/CP combinations. 

313 

Stan Eval 

The combinations are universal throughout the database; squadrons listed in the navigation panel serve only to display and filter MDS and CP. Once configured in one squadron, that MDS/CP 

combination will show the same configuration in all squadrons. For example, you associate CV-22B 

pilots in squadron X to a QUAL with Open Book and Closed Book requisites. CV-22B pilots in squadrons Y and Z wil have the same QUAL/Open Book/Closed Book combination. 

**CAUTION:** the above paragraph means if you change the associations in your squadron, they wil change for all other squadrons in your database with that MDS/CP. 

**1. ** Click Add/Edit Eval Types. 

**2. ** When the Edit dialog opens check/uncheck the Eval Type and click Save. 

**3. ** Click Add/Edit Requisites if the Eval Type has a Ground or Knowledge Phase requisite. 

**4. ** When the Edit dialog opens check/uncheck the Requisite\(s\) and click Save. 

**5. ** If the Eval Type or Requisite is no longer required, click the red X box and confirm. 

**6. ** Exclude from Tracking Desired Month Completion. As set in Preferences, requisites show as late once past their desired tracking month. If you do not want a requisite tracked and displayed as late, check this box. For example, the EPE is done in conjunction with the flight evaluation, not with the other requisites. 

**Mission Description **

**1. ** Select Squadron, MDS and CP. 

**2. ** Click Add, Edit or Delete Mission Description. 

**3. ** The Add dialog opens, already associated to the selected Squadron, MDS and CP. 

**4. ** Enter a Name. This is the name evaluators will use when selecting a mission description for a worksheet. 

**5. ** Enter the description. This is the description evaluators wil add to the worksheet. Once added, the description can be edited for individual evaluation worksheets without affecting the template description. 

**Mission Description Tactics, Techniques and Procedures: **

■ Use CTRL V to paste data into the Mission Description field. 

■ A useful technique is to use an underscore or similar for variables. For example, “The evaluation was conducted in the \_\_\_\_\_\_ MOA.” 

**Eval Forms **

For each person: 

■ Stan Eval Form. Select the appropriate evaluation form \(Forms 8, 8a, 4143, or 4350\) for an individual, if different from the squadron default. 

■ Eval Form Org. Enter the person’s desired signature block, but only if the person requires one different than their squadron/office default. 

■ Service. Change if not USAF \(e.g., USMC\). This entry appears on the eval form reverse when the evaluator is the first of two evaluators on one evaluation. 

To populate the various dropdowns, check people who are designated as: 314 

■ Reviewing Officer. 

■ Final Approving Officer. 

■ Default Reviewing Officer. This name will always appear the top of the dropdown list. 

■ Default Approving Officer. This name will always appear the top of the dropdown list. 

■ Examiner. 

■ Add Tng Officer / Cert Official. Additional Training Certifying Official. 

Check the Show Only Active Certs box to display only those people with a checked entry. 

**Eval Criteria **

This page associates MDS/CP evaluation criteria from the applicable AFI for inclusion on eval worksheets and draft eval forms. The criteria can be created here but most are on the PEX website. 

If your MDS/CP file is not on the web site, contact the PEX Help Desk to have it built. 

**NOTE:** The older .xml files can still be imported but are being replaced by the current .evalcrit type. 

Be aware that, if you import an older .xml format file with profiles, those profiles will import but cannot be edited or deleted. Applying new criteria from the Evaluation Criteria Tool tab will overwrite the old eval criteria, removing all existing profiles for that MDS/CP. 

Each area, or subarea, has a name, sequence number and grading criteria. It may also have a Description and Notes. Areas/subareas marked as Critical can be graded “Q” or “U” but not “Q-.” 

Grading uses the standard AF Stan/Eval system. This is a guide; reference the applicable AFI for specifics. 

• “Q” indicates the examinee demonstrated satisfactory knowledge and performance. 

• “Q-“ indicates the examinee is qualified but requires debriefing or additional training. 

• “U” indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters. An examinee receiving a grade of U requires debriefing or additional training, as determined by the examiner. 

**Evaluation Criteria Tool tab **

• New. Create a new eval criteria file. 

• Open. Open an eval criteria file stored locally. 

• Save. Save the eval criteria you are working on as an .evalcrit file. This saves as a file on your computer but it is not saved in PEX. 

• Apply. Apply the eval criteria you are working to a squadron, MDS and crew position. 

• Add Section. A grouping of grading areas. It does not have criteria or receive a grade. 

**o** Add Subsection. A sub-group of a section. It does not have criteria or receive a grade. 

• Add Area. A gradable criteria. However, if an area has subareas, the area is not gradable. 

**o** Add Subarea. A gradable criteria which is a sub-group of an area. 

**Evaluation Criteria tab **

315 

Stan Eval 

After eval criteria is created or imported in the Evaluation Criteria Tool, use the Evaluation Criteria tab to create profiles and apply the set to a squadron, MDS and crew position. A profile determines which areas/subareas appear on a worksheet. Required and Desired criteria appear on the worksheet, N/A criteria does not. For example, for an instructor upgrade eval, select only the instructor areas as Required. You must have at least one profile. 

**A. ** Click Add Profile. 

**B. ** When the dialog opens, name the profile. 

**C. ** Select each area/subarea as Required, Desired or N/A. 

**D. ** Import Eval Criteria. Imports only the older .xml file types. 

**Overview- Manage Your Stan Eval Program **

**Overview tab **

Overview provides a high-level view of your Stan/Eval program. 

**Rainbow **

**NOTE:** An individual can have multiple rainbow bars. Those with multiple MDS or crew position qualifications, or qualifications with different expiration dates. For example, a person with an INSTM/QUAL expiring in January and a MSN expiring in March. 

■ Select Squadron, MDS and Crew Position. 

■ Bar colors indicate the status of the flight evaluation phase: 

• Green: On Time 

• Orange: Late \(past desired month, not overdue\) 

• Red: Overdue 

• Blue: Waiver Extension 

■ Letters in the bars indicate in that month: 

• E: Primary evaluation desired 

• S: Primary evaluation scheduled 

• A: Primary evaluation successfully accomplished 

• U: Primary evaluation accomplished but unqualified 

• D: Requisites desired complete 

• R: Requisites completed 

■ The Monthly Totals table indicates the number of evaluations: 

• Desired Flight Month: In their desired primary evaluation completion month. 

• Expiration Month: In the last \(expiration\) month of the eligibility zone. 

• In-Zone: In their eligibility zone. 

■ Lists: 

316 

• Unqualified: people who have a failed or overdue evaluation. 

• Late Evals: people whose primary evaluations are past the desired completion month \(orange\) and have overdue evaluations \(red\). 

• Restrictions: people that have restrictions, Supervised Status is indicated with a red asterisk. 

• Late Requisites: displays people that are late \(Orange\) or overdue \(Red\) completing requisites. 

**Requisites **

■ Periodic Requisites. Lists people who are in-zone for an evaluation. It displays the evaluation type, remaining ground/knowledge phase requisites, and the eligibility period end date. The evaluation need not be open. Persons are grouped by Overdue, Expiration Month, and Initial \(INIT\) and Requalification \(RQ\). Requisites will drop from the list as they are successfully completed. 

■ Non Periodic Requisites. Lists people who have an open non-periodic evaluation. It displays the evaluation, remaining ground/knowledge phase requisites, and the evaluation completion date. Requisites will drop from the list as they are successfully completed. 

**Awaiting Signatures **

Lists people who have a completed evaluation and tracks evaluation review and signature progress. 

It displays the signatures due date, pre-signature reviews, released for signatures status, signature progress, and post review status. Clicking on pre-signature reviews, post reviews, and eval signatures links displays status. Clicking the pencil icon opens the form for signature. Clicking the padlock icon \(when visible\) unlocks and imports the form. See mailing an eval form for more on emailing, importing and exporting eval forms. . 

■ Due Date. Due date for the last signature \(examinee\). By default, 90 days from the date of the primary evaluation. This default can be changed in Setup > Preferences. 

■ Pre-Signature Reviews. You can identify up to eight reviews before the form is released for signature \(Setup > Preferences\). Use Awaiting Signatures to notify the next person in the review process. Unlike the automatic PEX notifications for signatures, notifications for reviews are done manually. This page shows how many \(X\) of the required reviews \(Y\) are complete \(X of Y\). The number of days is how long the review been ready for the next reviewer. Click the link to launch the signature summary dialog to view the next reviewer. A notification button lets you notify the next reviewer. N/A indicates the pre-signature review feature is not enabled. 

■ Released for Signatures. If pre-signature reviews are not enabled, this link will activate once the primary evaluation is complete and the Additional Reviewer and Final Approving Officer are identified. If the pre-signature review process is enabled, this link activates once the last review is completed and the Additional Reviewer and Final Approving Officer are identified. 

Clicking the Ready link releases the evaluation for signatures and starts the PEX notification process. Once released, a status of Completed will display. 

■ Eval Signatures. This column becomes active once the evaluation form is released for signatures. The information is displayed in the following format: “\(1 of 4\) Flight Examiner – 

317 

Stan Eval 

John C. Smith, Lt Col – for 2 days”. This means the first signature of four, from the flight examiner, is due and was notified two days ago. Clicking on this hyperlink brings up the signature manager dialog with additional details on the status, a means to digitally sign, and a link to preview the form. 

■ Post Review. If your squadron requires a Posted entry \(Setup > Preferences\), this link activates once the last signature is done. Once the post review is complete, the name and date are displayed. N/A indicates the post-signature review feature is not enabled. 

■ Historical Signatures. Displays the signature status of pending only evaluations, or look back 30, 60, 90, 180 days, or one year. 

**Trending **

PEX does not have a separate trend entry function. Any worksheet area or subarea graded Q- or U 

will feed Trending. 

**Trend by Discrepancies **

**1. ** Trend by a combination of sample size and percent, or minimum number. 

**A. ** Sample Size & Percent. 

**1\)** Sample Size. The minimum number of times an area is graded before it is considered for trending. For example, if your minimum sample size is five \(5\) and the area was graded only four \(4\) times during the time period, it won't show up on your trending data, even if it was downgraded all four times. 

**2\)** Percent. The percentage of times the evaluation area was downgraded. For example, if set to 50%, and the area was evaluated four times, and downgraded only once \(25%\), it won't show up on your trending data. 

**B. ** Minimum Number. The minimum number of times an evaluation area is downgraded before it is considered for trending. For example, if your Minimum Number is ten \(10\), and the area was evaluated 100 times but downgraded only nine \(9\) times, it won't show up on your trending data. To get al downgraded areas to show up, simply select Minimum Number 

= 1. 

**2. ** Enter the desired Date range. 

**3. ** Select the desired Eval Types. 

**4. ** Click Trend. 

**5. ** The downgraded areas section displays the area title, area number, number of times graded, and the number of times graded Q- and U. If desired, right-click and Export to Excel. 

**NOTE:** Trending discrepancies will appear after the Primary Evaluation is marked as complete. They do not wait until the evaluation form is signed off. 

**Status **

■ Evaluations. Lists people who have an open evaluation. It displays the evaluation type, all remaining requisites, and the due date. Persons are grouped by Expired, In-Zone, and NonPeriodic. Requisites will drop from the list as they are successfully completed. 

318 

■ Restrictions. Lists people who have a restriction and/or supervised status.

**Personnel- SEM Workspace **

319 

Stan Eval 

This topic describes the SEM workspace where most evaluation activity is accomplished. For specific use cases see TTPs- Administering Evals and Use Cases.  

**Personnel tab **

The Personnel section contains individual Person Detail pages, Eval Details pages, and evaluation folders/FEFs. An individual’s Person Detail page is, in essence, a digitized evaluation folder. 

Evaluations are administered in an individual’s Eval Details page. 

The “Personnel Search” function in the top right corner of every SEM page performs the same function as the Name Search and Advanced Search controls described below. 

The Most Recent People function is available only in Personnel menu button. This displays the last five people’s Person Details page accessed by you. 

**Name Search **

Access one person’s Person Details page. The smart type-ahead narrows the list of all people in your database, regardless of squadron, if you have permission to that squadron. 

**Advanced Search **

View all people filtered by squadron, MDS and crew position. 

**Import Forms **

Import Stan/Eval forms to a person or people. 

**Person Details **

Alternatively, display an image of the person’s unit, rank, badge, etc. Image files can be JPG or PNG types, and are imported using the Upload New Image or Use Webcam To Capture Photo buttons. Once in place, the image can be downloaded as a JPG using the Export Image to File button. 

■ Default Eval Form Type. Select the appropriate evaluation form \(Forms 8, 8a, 4143, or 4350\) for the person, if different from the squadron default. 

■ Eval Form Organization. Enter the person’s desired signature block, but only if the person requires one different than their squadron/office default. 

■ Service. Change if not USAF. This entry appears on the eval form reverse when the evaluator is the first of two evaluators on one evaluation. 

■ Is a Reviewing Officer and Is a Final Approving Officer. Check if the person occupy fills either role. 

**Menu **

320 

Use these menu buttons, or the right-click context menu functionality described in individual sections below. 

■ \+New. Add new tasks to this page. 

■ Forms. Access existing forms and import scanned forms to this page and Eval Folder. 

■ Sign. Sign open eval forms and MFRs. 

■ Eval Folder. Contains evaluation documentation. The sections described will not appear in the folder until an item is actually entered, e.g., a Major Discrepancy MFR. 

• Left side/Section I. Contains the summary forms \(AF942, AF1381, AF4348\) and Minor Discrepancy Log. Major discrepancy MFRs are listed separately under Major Discrepancies. 

• Right side. Contains the eval forms \(AF8, AF4350\) and Memos For Record \(MFR\). 

• Produce entire Eval Folder \(FEF\) as a PDF. The contents of an evaluation folder can be opened, saved and printed as a single PDF. Hovering on the Eval Folder button in Person Details opens a context menu with options to View and Print. Individual forms appear in the same order as displayed in the folder. 

**Qualifications **

Lists a person’s qualifications, current and past. If the qualification is periodic, PEX computes the Zone start date and expiration date based on settings in Preferences. If a person with existing qualifications is added to your database, manually or via ARMS import, those quals can be added manually. 

**■ Add/update qualifications automatical y. **

Simply administer the evaluation in PEX. Clicking Primary Eval Complete adds the qualification if it does not exist or, if already listed here, updates the existing qualification. If a combined evaluation, all included qualification types are updated. 

**■ Add/update qualifications manual y. **

• Right-click in the Qualifications grid, select Add, and the dialog opens. 

• For the last evaluation of that type: 

**o** Select the MDS, Qual Code and Crew Position, populated from the lists in Setup > Personnel. 

**o** Select the Last Evaluation Date, Wavier Expiration Date \(if any\), Eval Prefix \(if any\), and Qualification. 

**o** The Remarks section is for in-house remarks visible only to users with SEM access. 

The remarks do not appear outside of SEM or on any form. 

**o** Select Save or, to add multiple qualifications, Save and New. 

**■ Edit a qualification: add a wavier or active/inactive status. **

• Right-click on the qualification, select Edit, and the dialog opens. 

**o** Set a waiver by checking Waiver Expiration Date and adding the date. 

**o** Set the qualification to inactive by checking Inactive. This is useful for expired qualifications that will not be renewed soon \(e.g., non-flying TDY\) and for obsolete 321 

Stan Eval 

qualifications that are archived in PEX. Inactive qualifications will not appear in other dismays as overdue. They can be made active by unchecking the box. 

**Open Evaluations **

Lists a person’s open evaluations, i.e., evals that have been added but do not yet have at least one signature. Once a signature is on the eval form, the evaluation no longer appears here and must be accessed from Eval Forms/MFR \(see below\). 

**Add an evaluation **

■ Right-click in the Open Evaluations grid, select Add, and the dialog opens. 

• Eval in: select the MDS the evaluation was administered in. 

• Select the MDS, Qual Code and Crew Position, populated from the lists in Setup > Personnel. 

• Also Update: MDS or CP. For evals that cover multiple MDSs or crew positions. For MDS, use the Ctrl key to select multiple MDSs. For CP, click Add Qual/CP\(s\) and select required combinations of qual code and crew position. Use Save and New for multiple combinations. 

• Prefixes and Eval Types: Select an Eval Type, or multiple types for combined evaluations. 

With Type selected the associated Edit Prefix\(es\) button becomes active. Select the prefix associated that type. For example, for a recurring QUAL/MSN with an initial INSTR check, select QUAL with no prefix, MSN with no prefix, and INSTR with the INIT prefix. 

• Eval Form Type: defaults to the form selected in Preferences or for that person. 

• Qualification Period Generated By This Evaluation: select the number of months for which this evaluation is valid. For a 17-month cycle, enter 18 \(not 17\). This determines the expiration date for this evaluation. 

• Next Eligibility Zone: select the number of months for the eligibility zone generated by this evaluation. For example: set Qualification Period to 18 and Next Eligibility Zone to 6. If this eval is completed in January 2017, the next eligibility period begins in January 2018 and expires on 30 June 2018. 

• Other options: 

**o** Recheck Evaluation. Check if this is a recheck to correct a failed evaluation. 

**o** Ground Only Evaluation. Check this only for evaluations that include a Ground or Knowledge phase requisite with no Flight or Task phase requisite. For example, an eval that consists of an Open Book exam with no flight eval.

■ When adding the evaluation, in the Add Evaluation dialog, check the **Commander-Directed** **Downgrade** check box. 

■ No evaluator is added to the worksheet. 

■ The eval form reverse is formatted for the downgrade. 

■ Normally, the only signers are the Additional Training Certifying Official, Final Approving Officer and Examinee. If a ground recheck is recorded on the same eval form, the recheck evaluator signs the form reverse. 

■ The normal signature order is altered for a Commander or SIO-Directed Downgrade: \(1\) Final Approving Officer, \(2\) Additional Training Certifying Official, \(3\) Ground Recheck Examiner if required, \(4\) Examinee. 

**NOTES: **

■ If a Q3 evaluation is corrected with a new RQ Recheck Flight or Task Phase evaluation, the eval type must be the same as the Q3 in order to reset the examinee’s qualification status. For example, if the Q3 type is SPOT, the recheck must be SPOT or the examinee wil continue to show as unqualified for SPOT. 

■ If the Commander or SIO-Directed Downgrade has Ground or Knowledge Phase requisites, the RQ recheck will require completion of those requisites. 

■ If the Commander or SIO-Directed Downgrade is of periodic type, the RQ recheck wil reset the examinee’s expiration date. 

**Evaluation Form Signature Process **

Evaluation forms can be signed manually \(ink/wet\) or digitally \(CAC\). See Setup > Preferences to ensure your squadron is properly configured. 

334 

**CAUTION:** When switching modes, any evaluation with some but not all signatures will dump those signatures. In other words, an evaluation form must have all digital or all manual signatures. This does not affect evals with all signatures in place. 

**NOTE:** If an examinee's Personnel data has changed during the course of an evaluation, on clicking the Sign button, a messages pops asking if you would like to update these fields before signing.

**Testing Admin **

**Testing Admin Basics **

**Introduction **

The Testing Admin module allows you to create, assign, grade, record and track exams. Exams are created as proctored, non- proctored or practice. Proctored exams are assigned to examinees and require a proctor-designated user to permit the examinee access to the exam. Non-proctored exams are assigned to examinees and do not require a proctor. Practice exams are created and taken by any user without leaving a record. Trends can be assessed from proctored and non-proctored exams. Exams can be designated as requisites for Stan/Eval evaluations, or No-Go for periodic testing. Exams are taken in the Testing module. Testing reports are generated in Stan/Eval Reports. 

**Permissions **

Two permission roles can access Testing Admin, in addition to PEXAdmin and Administrator: 

■ Testing Administrator can perform any function in Testing Admin and Testing. 

■ Testing Evaluator is similar but cannot edit settings in Setup. Testing Evaluators can however, view, print and change displays in Setup. 

Permission roles are assigned in Users & Permissions. Proctors are selected in Setup. They need not have Testing permissions but must have Basic User or higher in the examinee’s squadron. 

**Rules **

■ Users cannot proctor their own exams. 

■ A grayed-out entry indicates it is in use and cannot be edited or deleted. 

**Module Notes **

■ QDBs are Question Data Banks \(a PEX term\) that serve as containers for your exam questions. 

■ It is not necessary to create identical exams in multiple squadrons. For example, create “CV-22A FE Open Book A” in squadron X. Assign the exam to people in squadron Z using the filters in Assign Exams. Neither the examinee nor proctor in squadron Z need have permissions to squadron X.

• **Requisite Exams** are exams designed to satisfy Ground or Knowledge Phase requisites to a Stan/Eval evaluation. Their status is displayed in the various Go/NoGo displays under the Stan/Eval banner. 

• **NoGo Exams** are not designed to satisfy Stan/Eval evaluation requirements. Their status is displayed in the various Go/NoGo displays under the TEST banner. PEX NoGo exams are designed to satisfy MAJCOM or unit requirements for recurring or one-time testing of such topics as emergency procedures, CAPS/Boldface or systems knowledge. 

• If, for example, your unit's monthly NoGo exam is CAPS, create a new exam type that is not checked as Requisite. For more see Setup- Configuring Testing Admin.  

**7. ** Check Proctored if the exam will require a proctor to monitor the examinee. 

**8. ** Check the No-Go box if the exam wil input to the No-Go process. 

For NoGo exams only, the selected MDS/CP determines NoGo status. For example, you create a NoGo exam selecting the MDS/CP of F-15E/Pilot, but assign it to all MDS/CP. Only F-15E 

pilots will see this exam displayed on the NoGo display. Once a No-Go exam is assigned, the examinee must take and pass the exam by the No-Go date you enter. If the person takes the exam and fails it, PEX automatically re-assigns the exam. PEX does not send an email notification of a failed or missed exam. 

**9. ** Check Repeat if you want the exam auto-assigned at specific intervals. When the dialog opens select the Start Date, Repeats \(repetition sequence\), End point and when it is first due. 

When you “assign” a repeating exam, the exam is actual y just scheduled. The exam is not actually assigned until the scheduled date arrives. 

**10. ** Set an Active Date if you want to delay when the exam is available for assignment. When set, the exam will not appear in the Assign Exams, Available Exams list until that date. If the exam is assigned to people and the Active Date is then set to an earlier date, it will remain assigned to those people. 

**11. ** Enter Date, Instructions and POC information as desired. 

**12. ** Select the MDS\(s\) Crew Position\(s\) to which this exam applies. This will filter the list of QDBs. 

354 

**13. ** From Question Data Banks, pick the ones to generate the exam \(required.\) Selecting the QDBs narrows the list of QDBs meeting your criteria. The resulting exam can still be assigned to any MDS or CP. The Exam Question Counter displays the number of questions left to select and will warn you if the number is exceeded. 

**14. ** Click Next. Depending on your question selection choice above: **A. ** **\(1\) **If you are selecting specific questions: 

**1\)** On this page select specific questions from the first QDB and click Add Questions.

**Maintenance **

**Maintenance Basics **

**Introduction **

The Maintenance module is the source of your units' aircraft data and functions as a link between operations and maintenance. It contains four modules. 

**1. Aircraft **

The Aircraft module contains three tabs: 

**A. ** The Aircraft tab lists your aircraft by Mission Design Series \(MDS\) and tail number, and assigns tail numbers to "owning" squadrons. 

**B. ** The Status tab contains a status board to manage and display aircraft tail number statuses and discrepancies. You can use Aircraft to track other vehicles, such as trucks. 

**C. ** The Setup tab configures the Maintenance module for your unit. 

**2. Aircraft Generation **

The Aircraft Generation module allows you to track the completion of al tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. 

**3. Reporting **

**4. Reports **

Reports provides maintenance a daily list of which load items \(munitions, ammo, chaff, flares, etc.\) installed on aircraft. It also provides an AF Form 2407 to track schedule changes.

Maintenance 

**Module Notes **

■ MDS is the type of aircraft, e.g., B-52H. Tail Number is the serial number of a particular airplane, e.g., 99-0001. This module can also be used to track other equipment \(vehicles, computers, etc.\), besides aircraft, by simply changing some labels. 

■ MDSs are PEX database wide. They are not by squadron. Your squadron can pick which MDSs to see in the Squadrons module. 

■ The tail number list is MDS and squadron specific. Highlight an MDS, then use the squadron drop-down located between the aircraft and tail number grids. The tail number grid will populate with the tail numbers assigned to that squadron and MDS. 

**Controls **

**Aircraft** and **Setup**. Access these procedures by navigating to Maintenance > Aircraft and the relevant tab. 

**Status**. Access these procedures by navigating to Maintenance > Aircraft > Status. The Status board opens in a new window. 

**Workspace **





**Aircraft **

**Setup tab **

**Introduction **

The Setup tab contains two sub-areas; the Settings and Lists used by your unit. 

**Workspace **

368 

!(images/000103.png)



**1. ** **Settings**. Select your unit's settings. 

**2. ** **Lists**. Manage which list items are used by your unit. Once created, list items are stored in the database Master List and associated to your unit. 

**3. ** **Squadron** selector. 

**4. ** **View/Edit** the Master List from the database. Associate a list item to your squadron if it exists, add it if it does not exist. 

**5. ** **Send Selected Items** to other squadrons. This aids in standardization between similar units. 

**Settings **

This allows the Maintenance Status board to automatically show an aircraft's status as Landed at a set number of minutes past its scheduled land time. 

Select your squadron. Use the rol er control to set the duration in minutes. 

**Lists **

These items are displayed in other maintenance and scheduling modules. They can be created here or, if already in your database, pulled from the Master List. Once created, they are added to the Master List, and can be sent to other units in your database. 

**REMIS MDS**. PEX populates a list of MDSs from the Reliability and Maintainability Information System \(REMIS\). Check the MDSs you need to view in the Aircraft tab > REMIS MDS dropdown list. 

**Configuration**. Enter a set of aircraft configurations, i.e., all-cargo, distinguished visitor \(DV\), etc. It can also be used for simplified Standard Configuration Load \(SCL\) codes. 

**Status Code**. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status codes such as "FMC" \(Fully Mission Capable\). 

Select the appropriate color. 

**Priority**. Enter your unit's mission Priority codes. 

369 

!(images/000001.png)

Maintenance 

**Symbol**. Enter/select aircraft maintenance status symbols such as "X" \(Major Discrepancy\). You can also enter Rankings for each. 

**Aircraft** **Parking** **Site**. Enter your unit's aircraft parking spots. If desired, enter the elevation and Latitude/Longitude. 

**Organization**. Enter units not listed in your PEX Locations module. For example, your unit is in temporary possession of an aircraft owned by another unit. This is displayed in the Aircraft tab > Tail Number grid. 

**Service**. Enter/select Codes used by nonspecific groups of forces, such as AIR FORCES or COMBINED. 

**Aircraft tab **

**Introduction **

This tab lists aircraft resources for display in other PEX modules and allows interfaces with other programs. Aircraft are listed by Mission Design Series \(MDS\) and associates individual tail numbers to those MDSs. Tail numbers are listed by owning squadron, and can be associated to shared squadrons. MDSs and Tail Numbers can be matched to their REMIS, ARMS, and Emoc identifications. 

**Workspace **



**1. ** **Aircraft MDS**. Create aircraft MDS designations in your database. Once created in the database, each MDS is available to any squadron by selecting Show MDS in Dropdowns in the Setup > 

Squadrons module. Assigning tail numbers \(below\) to a squadron populates functionality in that squadron. Associate the MDS used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. 

**2. ** **Squadron** dropdown selector. Select the squadron to which you want to assign a tail number. 

**3. ** **Tail Number**. Create tail numbers in your database, in the owning squadron, and share them with other squadrons. In the example above, the 80 FS owns 80-2002, but 80-2002 can also be scheduled by the 35 FS. Associate the tail number used in PEX to that used in ARMS, REMIS, and Emoc. Designate owning and possessing organizations. Check which tail numbers to show in the assigned squadron's tail number dropdown list. 

**Add an MDS **

**1. ** In the MDS grid, right-click, select Add from the menu 370 

**2. ** In the MD column enter the aircraft’s Mission and Design, e.g. C-130 

**3. ** In the S column and enter the Series e.g. J 

**4. ** PEX wil combine these in the read-only MDS column, e.g. C-130J. 

**CAUTION:** Do not attempt to circumvent this process by entering the entire MDS in the MD 

box. Doing so will result in problems with the way MDSs are displayed in the various modules, forms, and reports in PEX. 

**5. ** Match the PEX MDS to the ARMS MDS. The ARMS designation is used on the AFTO 781. 

**NOTE**. The CAMS MDS column is obsolete. Leave it blank. 

**6. ** The remaining columns are optional; however, Speed and Fuel Flow are necessary to use the Distance-Time-Fuel feature of the Mission Board. 

**Add a Tail Number **

Adding a tail number is required for full MDS functionality. 

**1. ** Right-click and select Add 

**2. ** Type in the tail number and select the squadron that owns it **3. ** Select the squadrons that share it. This will allow other squadrons to schedule the tail number. 

**4. ** Enter the ARMS ID so it shows up correctly on ARMS documents **5. ** Enter data in the remaining columns as desired 

**6. ** Show in Drop-Down. This column allows you to hide tail numbers throughout PEX. This prevents schedulers from accidentally scheduling an aircraft that’s not available due to prolonged down time. 

**Move a Tail Number to Another Squadron **

**1. ** Pick the MDS 

**2. ** Select the squadron that owns the tail number 

**3. ** In the Tail Number grid, locate the tail number you want to move, and in the Squadron dropdown column, change the squadron to the gaining unit 

**4. ** When the screen refreshes, the tail number wil disappear **5. ** Change the squadron selector, just above the grid, to the gaining squadron, and you wil see the moved tail number. 

**CAUTION:** Do not attempt to circumvent this process by adding a slightly-modified version of the same tail number in a different squadron. For example, don't have tail number 99-0001 in Squadron A and tail number 001 in Squadron B, when both are real y the same thing. If you 371

Maintenance 

do this, later on when you want to see what tail number .. 01 is doing, you'll have to select it in multiple places and won't get an overall view, because PEX thinks they are two different airplanes. If more than one squadron needs to schedule the same tail number, instead of adding it separately to each squadron, share the tail number. 



**Status tab **

**Introduction **

The Status board opens in a new window and contains displays three grids. The three grids can be moved, sized and closed independently. 

**Workspace **



**1. ** **Refresh**. The board refreshes automatically every ten minutes. It can also be refreshed manually. The Last Refresh field displays date and time, in local or Zulu, and Julian Date. 

**2. ** **Mission Capable Rates**. Mission Capable \(MC\), Fully Mission Capable \(FMC\), Partially Mission capable \(PMC\) and Not Mission Capable \(NMC\) rates are displayed as a percentage. 

**3. Page controls. **

**A. ** **Labels** allows for overwriting of existing column labels, or headers. For example, you can overwrite LOX with GOX. 

**B. ** **Page** **Settings** allows you to show or hide grids and functions. It also contains the Aircraft Status Output Service generation function. 

**C. ** Once the status board is configured, use **Save Page Layout** to save your display, or **Restore Page Layout** to return it to the original configuration.

**Aircraft Generation **

**Aircraft Generation - Setup **

**Introduction **

This module allows you to track the completion of all tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. 

**Permission Roles **

You need the Administrator role to setup the module. To monitor operations, you need the MX 

Scheduler role. The Ops Staff role can view the module. 

**Setup **

**1. ** **Add tasks. ** Tasks are a list of events that need to be accomplished in order to generate aircraft. Examples of these would be “Fuel”, “Weapons Load”, “Crew Acceptance”, etc. 

**A. ** Click the Add Task button or right click for the functionality. When adding a task enter Name, Default Duration in HH\+MM, and MDS. The task will be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to “Show In”. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the tasks select those squadrons to “Show In”. 

373 

Maintenance 

**B. ** Once the data is entered, you can either select “Save” to save the data and close the dialog or “Save & New” to add another task. You can Edit or Delete existing tasks by highlighting the task and selecting “Edit Task” or “Delete Task” from the toolbar action buttons or “Edit “ or “Delete” from the right-click context menu. 

**C. ** If a given squadron no longer uses a task, but other squadrons still need it, you can uncheck that squadron so they no longer see the task. In order to delete a Task, you must not have “visibility” or “active” selected for that Task. 

**2. ** **Build flows. ** Flows are a combination of Tasks grouped together to be accomplished in a logical sequence when generating an aircraft. Examples of these would be “Install tanks” then 

“fueling” etc. 

**A. ** Flows are added by selecting “Add Flow” from the toolbar action buttons or “Add” from the right-click context menu. When adding a flow, enter the Name. The Squadron dropdown filters the MDS list to be displayed. Once the MDS is selected, the available tasks for that MDS are populated in the left-hand grid. The Flow wil be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to “Show In”. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the flow, select those squadrons to “Show In”. 

**B. ** To include a Task on a flow, drag-n-drop a Task from the Available Tasks list to the right-hand grid. You can also use the Ctrl key to multi-select and drag multiple tasks at one time. 

Once the Tasks are added to the Flow, you can order them as applicable, again using drag-n-drop. 

**C. ** Once they are in the order you desire, select the Calculate Start/End Times to complete the process. By doing this, you wil see the start time, end time, and duration for each Task. 

**D. ** Once the data is entered, you can either select “Save” to save the data and close the dialog or “Save & New” to add another Flow. 

**E. ** You can make changes or delete a flow by highlighting it and selecting “Edit Flow” or 

“Delete Flow” from the toolbar action buttons or “Edit “ or “Delete” from the right-click context menu. 

**F. ** You can add or remove flows from a squadron by checking/unchecking the appropriate box. In order to delete a Flow, you must not have “visibility” or “active” selected for that Flow. 

**3. ** **Build a template. ** A template is a combination of Flows plus a specific number of aircraft. 

The Flows within the template may be “Offset” from each other for a cascade start and also may be “Delayed” from the actual start of the Operation. Examples of templates would be “12-Aircraft Red Flag” and “18-PAA Deploy” etc. They can also be used for future exercises or operations. 

**A. ** Templates are added by selecting “Add Template” from the toolbar action buttons or 

“Add” from the right-click context menu. The Template will be added as active and with your squadron selected as the squadron to “Show In”. If you want other squadrons to be able to use the template, select those squadrons to “Show In”. 

**B. ** To include a Flow on a Template, drag-n-drop a Flow from the Available Flows list to the right-hand grid. If you are going to use multiple instances of a Flow on the Template, you can enter that number in the “\# of Lines” and that number wil be added when you drag-n-drop that Flow. You can also use the Ctrl key to multi-select and drag multiple tasks at one time. 

374 

**C. ** Once the Flows are added to the Template, you can order them as applicable, again using drag-n-drop. Once they are in the order you desire, you can apply an Offset and/or Delay to the flows. 

**D. ** To apply an Offset and/or Delay, enter the desired Offset and/or Delay in the right-hand grid and using the Shift or Ctrl keys, select the Flows that you want them applied to. You can hover over the “Apply Offset/Delay” to see what will be applied in bold. If the Offset/Delay is correct select “Apply Offset/Delay” to apply. 

**E. ** Once the data is entered, you can either select “Save” to save the data and close the dialog or “Save & New” to add another Flow. 

**F. ** You can edit or delete a template by highlighting it and selecting “Edit Template” or 

“Delete Template” from the toolbar action buttons or “Edit “or “Delete” from the right-click context menu. In order to delete a template you must not have “visibility” or “active” 

selected for that template. 

**Aircraft Generation **

**Introduction **

This module al ows you to track the completion of al tasks that must be performed to generate aircraft for an operation. 

**Permission Roles **

You need the Administrator role to setup the module. To monitor operations, you need the MX 

Scheduler role. The Ops Staff role can view the module. 

**Usage **

**1. ** When an operation starts that needs aircraft generation, go to the Operations tab and select Add Operation from the toolbar. Enter the Name, Start or End Time, and Squadron of the Operation. 

**2. ** Select the Template you want to use. If it does not exist, please refer to the Setup help topic that explains how to add a template. 

**3. ** The Operation timing will be calculated based on whether you selected Start time or End time. If you enter Start time, times wil start at the time you designated and run for the duration of the Operation. If you selected End time, the calculation wil show you when you need to start your Operation in order to finish when desired. 

**4. ** Monitor the Operation by selecting the Operation Details toolbar the More Options \(. .\) button. This wil open the Details page, which can be moved to another monitor and left open. 

Additionally, you can set the refresh rate for this page. 

**5. ** On the Details page, you can see the complete Operation. Add the tail\# for each line using the dropdown. If there is an aircraft status in PEX it will be displayed in the Status column. 

**6. ** To track the Operation, enter the actual start and end times by clicking in the appropriate box and entering the time. If the actual time is on or before scheduled, the box wil highlight green. If the time entered is after the scheduled time, the box wil highlight red. If the Scheduled 375 

Maintenance 

time of the task passes with no Actual time having been entered, the Actual time field will turn yellow to help highlight the missing data. 

**7. ** You can edit the Operation by selecting the Edit Operation button in the upper left-hand corner. This allows you to edit the Name and Time of the Operation. You can choose to shift all times in the Operation at this point. Additionally, you can Add, Edit, or Delete Flows from the Operation using the toolbar More Options \(. .\) button. If you want to save the changed Operation as a new Aircraft Generation Template, select Save as New Generation Template in the lower right-hand corner. 

**Handle Similar MDSs in PEX **

\(For example, F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D\) 

**1. ** **Maintenance, Aircraft, MDSs**. Each MDS should be entered individual y in the MDS grid, e.g., F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Also, for exporting AFTO 781 data, the ARMS MDS, e.g., F016A, for each should be identified in this grid. 

**2. ** **Maintenance, Aircraft, Tail Numbers**. Each Tail Number should be assigned to its associated MDS, e.g., the F-16A Tail Numbers should be assigned to the F-16A and so forth. Also, for exporting AFTO 781 data, the ARMS ID for the tail number should be identified in this grid. 

**3. ** **Setup, Personnel, Qualifications**. If a person is qualified to fly in more than one MDS, each MDS should be identified in the Quals & Certs tab > MDS/CP Qualification grid. For example, if the person is an instructor pilot that can fly all four models of F-16, that person should be assigned MDS Qualifications of F-16A IP, F-16B IP, F-16C IP, and F-16D IP. The model that is most frequently flown should be marked as the “Primary” MDS/CP qualification. 

**4. ** **Setup, Personnel, Certifications**. Pick one of the similar MDSs and enter all the certifications there, e.g., enter al F-16 certifications under “F-16C”. As a technique, to indicate a person is also certified in other F-16 models, you could create an “F-16C” certification called “F-16A”, another called “F-16B”, and another called “F-16D”. 

**5. ** **Scheduling, Flying Schedule, Sortie MDS**. In the Sorties grid, in the MDS column, the desired MDS for the sortie should be identified. Once a Tail Number for the sortie is established, the true MDS should be updated, if required. 

**6. ** **Stan Eval, Testing, QDBs and Exams**. If the QDB/Exam pertains to multiple MDSs, associate the QDB/Exam to all applicable MDSs simultaneously. For example, if a QDB/Exam applies to all types of F-16, associate it to F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. 

**7. ** **Stan Eval, Management, Setup, Assoc Eval Types & Reqs**. Select the first MDS, e.g., F-16A, and enter the Eval Types and Requisites for it. Do the same for the other MDSs, e.g., F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Normally, the Eval Types and Requisites will match for each MDS. 

**8. ** **Stan Eval, Management, Qualifications**. Add a qualification for each MDS the person is authorized to fly. For example, if an Instrument evaluation in the F-16C also qualifies the person for Instrument in the other F-16s, enter an Instrument qualification in all four, i.e., F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. Each qualification should have the same “Last Evaluation” date. 

**9. ** **Stan Eval, Management, Open Evaluations**. When adding an Open Evaluation, make sure to identify which MDS\(s\) also get updated as a result of the primary evaluation. For example, the Instrument evaluation may be conducted in the F-16D and it “Also Updates” the F-16A, F-16B, and F-16C. 

376 

**10. ** **Stan Eval, FCIF Admin**. If the read file item pertains to multiple MDSs, associate the read file item to all applicable MDSs simultaneously. For example, if an item applies to all types of F-16, associate it to F-16A, F-16B, F-16C, and F-16D. 

**11. ** **Ops, Go/No-Go**. If the above procedures are fol owed, the Go/No-Go page will display the correct data for Testing, FCIF, and Stan Eval, whether the page is filtered by MDS/CP, Msn/Sortie, or by Shift. 

**12. ** **AFTO 781**. If the above procedures are followed, the AFTO 781 data will export correctly to the ARMS database. 

**Maintenance Reports **

**Daily MX Loads **

**Introduction **

This report provides maintenance a daily list of which load items \(munitions, ammo, chaff, flares, etc.\) to install on the aircraft. The report is found at Maintenance> Reports> Daily MX Loads. 

**Permission Roles **

To view/print this report, you need Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff permission role. 

**Before using the report **

**1. ** To get data to show up in the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, OTHER, AMMO, CHAFF, or FLARES 

columns, you first must have Load Item Types of ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, Other, Ammo, Chaff, and/or Flares in the Weapons > Munitions > Setup list. Then, specific Load Items must be categorized as one of those as the Load Item Types. Finally, schedule that particular Load Item onto a sortie station using the Flying Schedule> Loads tab. 

**2. ** The report works best when Load Items are entered as Code numbers and names. The Load Item Name would be the plain text definition, e.g., Code = 46 and Name = Mk-82 Hi Drag. 

**3. ** To minimize confusion, we recommend using distinct load item Codes/Names even across different types of load items. For example, don’ t have load item code "42” which is an AIM-9 

missile and another load item code "42” which is a travel pod. However, if you do use the same load item code/name across different types, the bottom legend will list which specific load item goes on which line number. 

**Run the report **

**1. ** Pick whether you want the report ordered with formations together or just strictly by MX 

Line \#. Spare aircraft \(any line number which includes the letters "SP”\) are listed at the bottom. 

**2. ** Pick whether you want the report to list al stations for the MDS or just the ones that have something on them \(Populated Stations\). Although Populated Stations shortens the report greatly, some people become confused when they don’t see al the stations listed \(the empty ones\), so you have an option. 

**3. ** Pick the date range of interest and whether you want times in Local or Zulu. 

377 

Maintenance 

**4. ** Pick whether you want the Load Item Code shown vertically \(for long ones\) or horizontally \(for short ones\). 

**5. ** Pick the Squadron\(s\), MDS\(s\), and Munition Project Number\(s\) of interest. 

**6. ** Pick the columns of interest. If you select for display the following columns: ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER; the load items of those types wil appear under those columns and not under a station. If you want those types of load items to appear under the station, do not select the ECM, LANTIRN, NACTS, or OTHER columns for display. 

**7. ** Click PDF or Excel to generate the report. 

**NOTE:** Depending on your Excel trust center settings, on the Windows File Download dialog you may need to Save the report first instead of Opening it directly. 

**Weekly Frag Request **

**Introduction **

This report is provided by Ops to munitions personnel to specify how many of each load item are scheduled by day, for five days. The report is found at Maintenance > Reports > Weekly Frag Request. 

**Permission Roles **

To view/print this report the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role. 

**Before using the report **

**CRC**: Complete Round Codes \(CRC\) are entered in the Weapons module by editing the individual Load Item. This is a one-time setup step. 

**Setting**: Settings are entered in the Flying Schedule module on each sortie Station. When you enter station Settings, those settings will appear for every Load Item on that Station on the Weekly Frag Request. Settings are normal y fuse settings. 

**Mount**: 

■ To setup mounts and/or pylons, enter “Mount” \(case sensitive\) as a Load Item Type. Then add your specific mounts and/or pylons as Load Items, making sure to select “Mount” as the Load Item Type. This is a one-time setup step. 

■ To schedule mounts and/or pylons, add the mount/pylon as a normal load item to a station. 

Then, onto the same station, schedule other load items that wil be attached to the mount/pylon. On the Frag Report, each load item will now list the mount/pylon “Description” 

\(not Name\) in the Mount column of the report. 

**Run the report **

Pick the start date of the five-day range and whether you want times in Local or Zulu. 

Pick the MDSs, Munition Project Numbers, Categories, and Load Item Types of interest. 

Select PDF or Excel to generate the report. 

378 

**NOTE**: Depending on your Excel trust center settings, you may need to "Save" the report first, as the 

“Open" option may be blocked our will generate an Excel error message. 

**Munitions grouping **

The report groups load items by Squadron, Munition Project Number, and MDS. 

**Quantity \(Qty\) and Spare \(Sp\) calculations **

The Qty column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on primary aircraft. The Sp column shows the number of that particular load item scheduled for that day on spare aircraft \(line numbers which include "Sp."\). The TOTAL column at the end shows the total of that particular load item scheduled for that week on primary aircraft plus the last \(not total\) Spare quantity for the week. In other words, the TOTAL column does not add up al the Sp for the week but uses the last daily value. 

**AF 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination **

**Introduction **

The PEX AF Form 2407 documents mission changes. 

**Permission Roles **

To view/print this form the user needs Flight Scheduler, Maintenance Scheduler, OPS Desk, Supervisor of Flying, or OPS Staff role. 

**Setup **

You must use the Mission Board to Commit \(firm\) missions. From then on, when changes are made to squadron-specified fields on a committed mission, PEX allows you to enter information about why the change was made. This change information wil show up on the 2407. 

**Generate the form **

Navigate to Maintenance > Reports > AF 2407 tab. Select your desired squadron and the schedule changes you want on the form.

**Setup **

**External Interfaces **

**Scheduling Interface Introduction **

**Overview **

The Setup > External Interfaces module serves as a consolidated location to establish, manage and monitor data-exchange connections between PEX and other scheduling applications, including: **1. ** Unit Command and Control \(UC2\) 

**2. ** Enhanced Maintenance Operations Center \(EMOC\) 

**3. ** Theater Battle Management Core Systems-Force Level \(TBMCS-FL\) **4. ** Graduate Training Integration Management System \(GTIMS\) **5. ** Central Scheduling Enterprise \(CSE\) 

**UC2, EMOC and TBMCS-Force Level **

Some locations conduct squadron operations using PEX while conducting various wing operations using UC2, EMOC, and TBMCS-FL. Data is shared between systems allowing PEX users access to relevant information. If properly configured and operated, the end result is a reduced reporting burden on the squadrons and enhanced communication to higher headquarters. UC2/EMOC 

maintains aircraft and aircraft status data. Updated data are exchanged between PEX and UC2, while EMOC can update both PEX and UC2. PEX does not directly update EMOC, although PEX can update UC2 which then flows EMOC. 

**NOTES:** 

■ In PEX, connectivity is established between these four systems \(PEX, UC2, EMOC and TBMCS-FL\) in two tabs. Once established however, operations in PEX appear seamless to schedulers. 

■ Not all data flows to each program. 

■ Typically, an AOR/AOC will have a single TBMCS-FL database, while an individual location may have one UC2 database and multiple PEX databases. 

**GTIMS **

PEX imports scheduling data from GTIMS and displays the information in the Ops > Waterfall 

module. 

381 

!(images/000021.jpg)

!(images/000107.jpg)

Setup 

**CSE **

CSE is a computerized system for the scheduling of all missions requiring the use of specific ranges or support resources. 

**Scheduling data interfaces outside of the External Interfaces module** Two interfaces are not active connections but simple file imports. Users normally download these files from a hosting website. Although the interfaces are not part of this module, the imported data is used throughout PEX scheduling functions. 

■ **Air Tasking Order \(ATO\)** files \(\*.ato\) are imported into PEX in the Scheduling > ATO module, creating mission shells. These shells can then be edited with local data in the various PEX 

scheduling modules \(Mission Board, Flying Schedule, etc.\) 

■ **Airspace Control Order \(ACO\)** files \(\*.aco\) are imported into PEX in the Setup > TaskView 

module, creating and/or updating location data in the Setup > Locations module. 



**Status **

**Overview **

The Status tab shows connection status for al External Interface functions, after they have been configured in their respective tabs.

**Central Scheduling Enterprise \(CSE\) **

**Overview **

Central Scheduling Enterprise \(CSE\) is a computerized system for the scheduling of all missions requiring the use of specific ranges or support resources. PEX Airspaces equate to CSE Ranges. 

Airspace locations are manually created in PEX > Locations. Range locations are imported from CSE. 

These two are then mapped together in Setup > Resources. PEX schedulers create missions in the PEX Mission Board, including airspace, and send a request for that airspace to CSE, via an automated interface. 

**NOTES: **

■ Once a mission is sent to CSE and accepted, it cannot be re-sent. 

■ PEX 5.15 interfaces only with CSE-Nellis. 

■ Imported range locations are Read Only. 

■ A mission must have a valid Range Project Number to be accepted by CSE.

**A. ** A pop up informs you CSE Range Import Successful. 

**B. ** Consult the CSE Range Import log file as required. The file reflects ranges successfully imported. If this range import is an update, as opposed to the initial import, it may also reflect ranges removed from the PEX database. 

**Map PEX Airspace Locations to CSE Ranges **

Corresponding airspaces must be added in Setup >  Locations before PEX and CSE locations can be mapped. 

**1. ** Go to Setup > Resources > Types > Airspace List and view the list of Airspace locations from Setup > Locations. 

388 

**2. ** Select an Airspace, and the Airspace Details flyout on the right displays those CSE ranges, if any, currently mapped to the airspace. Each range is considered by PEX to be a "group" and will appear as such under the Airspace Details List. 

**3. ** In the Airspace Details, click on the pencil icon to edit the ranges mapped to the airspace. 

This will open the Edit Airspace flyout. 

**A. ** To map ranges to the airspace: 

**1\)** In the Resource Groups section, select Add to add ranges to the airspace. 

**2\)** In the Add Resource Groups flyout, the ranges not yet mapped to the airspace wil be listed. 

**3\)** Select the checkboxes for those ranges to be mapped to the airspace. 

**4\)** Select Done when al ranges have been selected. This wil return you to the Edit Airspace flyout. 

**5\)** Select Save. 

**NOTE:** Use the type ahead Search box at the top of the Add Resource Groups fly out to filter the list of ranges. 

**B. ** To unmap ranges from the airspace: 

**1\)** In the Resource Groups section, click on the red box with an X for the airspace to be unmapped. 

**2\)** In the Confirmation dialog, select Yes or No as appropriate. 

**3\)** Continue clicking on the red boxes until al airspaces to be unmapped have been removed. 

**4\)** In the Edit Airspace flyout, select Save. 

**4. ** To view all of the ranges mapped to each airspace at one time, in upper right corner of Resources page, select More Options \(. .\). Select Show Groups. To hide the ranges, select More Options \(. .\), then Hide Groups. 

**NOTE:** Range mapping can be edited. The actual imported ranges cannot be edited. 

**Workflow **

**1. ** Schedule missions as normal in the Mission Board.  Missions that will be sent to CSE must have at least one Airspace mapped to CSE ranges and a valid Range Project Number \(Range Proj 

\#\). If these columns are not visible in the Sorties grid, unhide them using the View control. 

**2. ** When ready to send range requests to CSE, go to Scheduling > Flying Schedule > Sorties tab. 

**3. ** Click the CSE Export button, and the CSE Mission Export page is opened, with the Mission Filter flyout also open. 

**4. ** Set filter by Squadron\(s\), Zulu/Local, Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. 

**5. ** You can filter further by MDS and Airspace. 

**6. ** Click Load. 

**7. ** The CSE Mission Export page opens with all missions meeting your filter criteria.

**9. ** Check all missions to be sent to CSE. 

**10. ** When satisfied, click the Export to. . button, and Yes or No to the confirmation dialog. 

**11. ** An Export Result Log dialog opens listing each exported mission. For each, a REJECTED or ACCEPTED BY CSE status is displayed. If rejected, a CSE error code and reason describe the error. 

Rejected and accepted totals are displayed at bottom. If you need to refer to this log file in the future, go to Setup > External Interfaces > Status tab, and call applicable the log file. 

**12. ** In addition to Airspace and Range Project Number, PEX validated in CSE include: Squadron, MDS, Weapon Load Items and Codes, and Complete Round Codes \(CRC\). 

**13. ** For any rejected missions, edit the data as required in the Mission Board or Flying Schedule and re-send. 



**Scheduling Operations **

Local procedures and command guidance determine when to pass ATO mission scheduling information from PEX to UC2. Communications traffic between the two systems will be minimized the more complete the schedule is before the subscription occurs. 

390 

**NOTE**: Operational reporting requirements may dictate UC2 subscribing to an ATO before the schedule has been firmed. This is especial y likely during periods of around the clock operations. 

Missions in PEX which are not associated with an ATO are called “Local Missions” and those missions are passed to UC2 immediately upon creation, if a known MDS has been assigned. 

The following data enables certain actions: 

■ Assigning a mapped MDS to a sortie allows the mission to flow from PEX to UC2. 

■ Assigning a Tail number to a PEX sortie allows UC2 RMA to display the ATO SCL. The PEX load sets, SCLs, and Auto generated SCLs are of no interest to UC2 and are not shared. 

■ The Mission Number in UC2 allows for only 8 characters; if it is longer than 8 UC2 will not display the mission. 

■ The mission type assigned in PEX must be less than seven characters long or UC2 cannot display the type in RMA. 

■ When a mission is “Committed” in PEX, UC2 will interpret that status as “Scheduled”. Prior to that action, the UC2 status is “Tasked” 

■ When the first sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Departure entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as “Take Off”; the earliest ATD will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL as 

“Mission Actual Start Time” 

■ When the last sortie of a mission has an Actual Time of Arrival entered in PEX, UC2 will interpret the mission status as “Landed” and the data will be forwarded to TBMCS-FL as 

“Mission End Time” 

■ Maintenance Line numbers are used by EMOC to identify sorties in both UC2 and PEX, and these line numbers must be unique to an ATO period, which usual y does not correlate to a calendar day \(Local or Zulu\). ATO days can be from, for example, 06:00Z to 05:59Z. 

**NOTE**: PEX has an “Auto Line Number” function which may result in violating this condition, dependent on the missions displayed, the ATO cycle and unit numbering conventions. 

Operations and Maintenance personnel must coordinate this process. 

The following information is displayed in UC2 RMA based on PEX scheduling information: 

■ Line number 

■ Mission Type \(if less than 7 characters\) 

■ Mission CNX \(Cancelled\) 

■ Assigned Squadron 

■ Call sign 

■ Flying period \(only numeric, not alpha\) 

■ MDS/Tail Number 

■ ATO SCL 

■ ATO Secondary SCL 

■ The first two crew members \(if known to UC2, else UNKNOWN\) 

■ Sortie Brief time 

■ Sortie scheduled and actual takeoff 

391 

Setup 

■ Sortie takeoff and land location 

■ Sortie scheduled and actual landing 

■ Sortie CNX 

■ Sortie Remarks 

**TTPs **

■ PEX permits operations which may or may not be in accordance with AOR operational procedures. For example, cancelling a local \(non-ATO\) mission through the use of the Mission Board “CNX mission” function would probably be an accepted practice, while performing the same action on an ATO mission would be outside the authority of unit schedulers. ATO 

missions are typically cancelled through an ATO change. Use of PEX and UC2 does not guarantee all operational directives will be complied with. 

■ PEX and UC2 displays wil not necessarily display the same missions, even though both systems contain the same missions. This is because of the use of Zulu versus Local times and various PEX filtering abilities such as “Show Sorties by TO Date”, “Filter By Sortie Type”, and “Filter by MDS”. 

■ EMOC can accept only unique line number/ATO date combinations. For example, two line numbers “300” during one ATO cycle wil be a problem even if they are on two different calendar dates. Use of PEX “Auto Line Number” function may result in duplicates which must be resolved manually. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 will create the tail number and In PEX you will need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module. Then in the UC2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UC2 to PEX. EMOC operators can perform a tail number swap between lines and they can enter/modify actual take off and land times on a sortie. If EMOC adds a tail number to a mapped unit and MDS, then UC2 wil create the tail number. In PEX you wil need to add the new tail number in the Aircraft Module and then in the U2 module you wil need to map it to the UC2 tail number. EMOC operators can modify aircraft status and that information will flow through UL to PEX. 

■ ATO mission information will be imported into PEX from a 2000/2004 or NATO ATO file. PEX 

then creates missions and sorties which appear on PEX mission/sortie displays. After scheduling manipulation in PEX, the UC2 operator will poll PEX for available ATOs and select the ATO of interest. They import the ATO and then the systems subscribe to changes. Al missions and sorties associated with the ATO of interest will flow to UC2, but only a subset of the data associated with those missions and sorties is exchanged. After that, any “Change ATO” or manual change to an ATO mission/sortie will automatically flow to UC2. At a certain point, UC2 passes ATO mission data to TBMCS-FL. There is no indication in PEX as to whether UC2 has subscribed to any particular ATO. See the ATO help topic for how to import an ATO. 

**Labels **

Many of the tab names and column headers in PEX can be re-named. This re-labeling is useful for re-purposing otherwise unused columns, for example. Re-labeling is accomplished differently depending on whether you are working on an older PEX module or a newer one. The newer ones have a Page Settings button near the top-right of the screen. 

392 

**Re-label in newer modules. **Click the Page Settings button and select Edit Labels. ** **

**Re-label in older modules. **Go to Setup > Labels \(WinPEX only\). The Labels tab lists the older screens within PEX that contain modifiable labels. Selecting a PEX screen will display the labels within that screen. ** **

The displayed Default Label Text can be changed to user-defined labels by entering Override Label Text. Once the override text is entered it wil replace the default text in the applicable screen. 

Changes made here are applied throughout the database by squadron. If the affected module is open, the change will not take effect until it is re-opened. 

**Locations **

**Concept **

The Locations module allows you to enter locations for scheduling purposes and provides a quick reference for location information. Locations can be entered from any of four sources: manually-input PEX locations \(the most common\), PFPS, ATO, and ACO locations. PFPS, ATO, and ACO locations are added automatically during interfaces with those respective programs. 

**Existing Locations **

The Locations tab lists all the locations contained in your database. The locations grid allows filtering, adding, deleting, and editing of each location. Using the Selection Criteria area, you can filter locations by Source, Type, Location name, or Description. Enter your selections and click Display Data. The Locations tab shows you all the locations in a spreadsheet view. If you pick a location and go to the Details tab, you’ll see all the particulars about that location in a form view \(easier for editing\). 

**Setup before I use the module **

Go to the Setup tab to manage the lists of Countries, Country Codes, and Location Types used throughout the Locations module. \(Radio Frequency Types and Theaters are not used anywhere in PEX.\) Right-click and Add to add an entry. To delete an entry, right-click and Delete. To edit an entry, click on the field and enter the data. Click off the row to save. 

**Add a location **

First, ensure that the location does not already exist in the database. Sometimes, a location is mistakenly entered twice, with a slight variation in the name or description, which causes problems when using two PEX locations that are essential y the same place. Place the cursor in the Locations grid, right-click and select Add. Enter the supporting data and save the location. Latitude and Longitude are not required fields; however, they are necessary if you plan to use the Distance-Time-Fuel feature of the Mission Board. Most entries are self-explanatory. Not self-explanatory are: **Latitude and Longitude **

Longitude allows N or S, with any format with at least XX degrees. You can enter any degree, minute, or second combination out to the 6th decimal place. For example, you can enter: XX.XXXXXX degrees 

393 

Setup 

XX degrees, and XX.XXXXXX minutes 

XX degrees, XX minutes, and XX.XXXXXX seconds 

XX degrees, XX minutes, and XX seconds 

Latitude allows E or W, with any format with at least XXX degrees in the same formats as listed for longitudes. 

**Set Zulu Offset **

In the Zulu Offset drop-down, select how many hours the location is normally offset from Greenwich Mean Time \(GMT\). Then, select a Daylight Saving Time \(DST\) rule from the DST Rule Dropdown. 

**Show in Dropdowns **

Check this box to display the location throughout the rest of PEX. When the location is no longer used, un-check the box. 

**Frequencies **

This is not used for anything in PEX. We recommend not entering data here. It al ows you to enter several radio frequencies associated with the location. To add a new frequency, place the cursor in the Frequency grid, right-click and select Add. A new frequency line will be generated. Enter the control ing agency and the frequency. To delete a frequency, highlight it, right-click and select Delete. 

A warning will appear, click Yes, and the frequency wil be deleted. Frequencies entered here do not show up anywhere else in PEX. 

**Delete a location **

Many times, you cannot. Once a location has been used \(scheduled\), it cannot be deleted. To delete an unused location, highlight the location, right-click and select Delete. A warning appears. Click the Yes button and the location is deleted. 

**Personnel **

**Personnel Basics **

**Introduction **

The Personnel module is where you enter and manage the personnel data of individuals in the PEX 

database. Personnel must be entered here before they can be used in the Scheduling, Training, or Stan/Eval modules. People, and their data, may be added manually, via an ARMS import, or by importing their personnel file from another PEX database. Existing data may be updated manual y or via the ARMS import. 

**Permissions **

■ PEXAdmin user has full permission to all squadrons in a database. 

■ Users with Administrator or Training Auditor/ARMS permission can Add, Edit or Delete items in this module. 

394 

!(images/000000.jpg)

■ A Basic User can view their personal information without having access to others' information. 

They can add, edit and delete their contact information. 

**Rules **

Personnel are identified by their ID\#, normally the social security number. The ID\# is unique to the database, meaning two personnel records cannot have the same ID\#. 

**Caution:** Each person should have a single personnel record in the database. If a person has duties in multiple squadrons, they can be assigned permissions in those squadrons. If a person does have two personnel records, one record would require a "dummy" ID\#. These records cannot be merged. 

An exception to this might be a person having two jobs in the same unit. For example, a person may be a contractor, while also holding a traditional ANG position. 

**Module Notes **

Information contained in the Personnel module is referred to as a *personnel record*. A *user account* establishes a person's PEX login and permission roles. Most people have both a personnel record and a user account. Some people only have a personnel record, allowing them to be tracked and scheduled for events, e.g., guest help. Others only have a user account, al owing them to log in and view information, e.g., base operations. For more on user accounts see Setup > Users & Permissions. 

The dropdown menus in Personnel are editable in the Personnel > Setup tab. Navigate to the Setup tab and look for the desired field, or, in the dropdown, simply click on Edit Values. For more see 

Setup - Configure Personnel for your unit.

**Personnel Details by tab **

This topic describes in detail functionality in individual Personnel module tabs. If a specific function is "greyed-out" or un-editable on a particular page, go to the source page to make edits. 

**Personnel **

This tab consolidates all personnel data for all persons in the database. In the Fly Sq dropdown, you can access any single squadron, or all squadrons, to which you have permission. Most columns are self-explanatory, some warrant further explanation. The process for importing, exporting and manually creating personnel records is described in Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel. 

■ The Φ symbol indicates fields that are overwritten with each ARMS import. Meaning, if you change the data in a field, importing an ARMS csv will set that field to whatever is in ARMS. 

This feature can be overridden in Continuation Training. 

■ ID\# is normal y a person's social security number but can be any nine-digit number. Each person's ID\# is unique to the database, meaning no two personnel records can have the same ID\#. 

■ Fly Sq is the squadron to which the person is assigned. If in ARMS, a person's Fly Sq should match that in ARMS. These squadrons come from the Setup > Squadrons module. 

■ Non-Fly Sq is for squadrons to which a person is attached for other duties. This dropdown list is populated from the Personnel > Setup page. 

■ Eval Form Org overwrites signature blocks on evaluation forms. See Stan Eval for more. 

■ DNIF sets a person as DNIF on the Go/NoGo board. Changing DNIF status here functions the same as that in Go/NoGo. 

■ Service Status sets a person to follow rules for people who are A-Active Duty, R-Air Force Reserve, or G-Air National Guard. 

■ Call Sign is a free text entry to associate a call sign to an individual. It cannot be assigned to a sortie. 

396 

■ UD 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are User Defined. These columns can be used for any data with no existing field. UD 1, 2, 6 and 7 are dropdowns, configurable in the Setup tab. UD 3, 4, and 6 are free-text. 

■ Pri Exp Risk feeds the ORM module. 

■ Avail Enabled enables/disables availability for a specific person, for units with both active duty and reserve personnel. 

■ Teams enable individuals to be assigned to unit-defined teams. Unlike squadron, flight or office symbol, an individual an be assigned to multiple teams. 

■ Export AFTO 781 Data. Checking No blocks the export of 781 data for guest flyers, or people who fly with your unit but are not assigned to your unit. 

■ Exporting personnel data to the Defense Readiness Reporting System \(DRRS\) is accomplished by right-clicking on a row, selecting Export to DRRS, and saving the file to your local computer. 

**Details **

This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus is the primary tab for adding SEI and supervisor data. 

■ To add SEI identifiers, right-click in the SEI grid and select the appropriate identifier from the dropdown list. 

■ To select supervisors, right-click in the Supervisor grid, select the Fly Sq and Supervisor. This can also be accomplished in the Supervision tab. 

**Duties **

This tab incorporates some of the functionality described in the Personnel module, plus adds Additional Duties. Right-click in the Additional Duties grid and select the desired duty. 

**Contact **

This tab allows you to add multiple street addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. For each, right-click in the Addresses, Phone Numbers or Email Addresses grid. First select a Type, then fill in the appropriate information. 

**NOTE:** Within each grid, each entry must have a unique type, such as Home or Work. I.e., a person cannot have more than one "Home" phone number. You can however, create additional types of, e.g., Home 1, Home 2, etc. in Setup. 

**Quals **

This tab is were you can add and delete MDS/Crew Positions and related data. To be able to effective utilize personnel data in the various PEX modules, it is essential for all personnel records to have at least one MDS and Crew Position selected. One MDS/CP must be selected as Primary. Others can be added as required. 

■ If in ARMS, a person's qualification code and crew position is included in the ARMS import. 

MDS must be selected manually. 

■ If not in ARMS, or if the person holds multiple MDSs or crew positions, add an MDS/CP be selecting right-click, select Add, and fill in the required data. 

397 

Setup 

**Status **

The Status tab is intended to identify people on Title 10 or Title 32 status, with inclusive dates, but can be used to identify people on any unit-status such as DNIF or Deployed. Right-click and select Add. When the dialog opens select the Status type, Effective Date and Expiration Date, and add any remarks. 

**Supervision **

The Supervision tab allows you to designate supervisors. This is similar to the function in the Details tab. Here however, first select the Supervisor's Short Name in the dropdown. In the filterable Available Personnel grid, check the names of all people the person supervises, then click Assign. 

Those names will move to the Assigned Personnel grid. As a supervisor, you can view information on your supervisee's in My Page > Folders > My Supervisee's. 

This can also designate in-turn supervision. For example, Capt Martìnez supervises MSgt Smith, who in turn supervises SrA Goldstein. First set Martìnez as Smith's supervisor, then set Smith as Goldstein's supervisor. 

**Roster **

The Roster tab is used to create, print and export-to-Excel rosters. 

**1. ** In the columns grid, select the fields desired. 

**2. ** Drag-and-drop the selected fields to the order desired. 

**3. ** In the Sections grid, select Sections and Types. This can be used to select specific types, e.g., work and cel phone numbers while ignoring home and fax numbers. 

**Setup **

This topic describes functionality in the Personnel > Setup tab. For more on how to setup the overal personnel module see the topic \_\_\_\_\_ . 

The Setup tab contains those data which populate the Personnel dropdowns. The Tables list equates to labels, or column headers. Selecting a table name displays the selections available for that label. 

**NOTE:** The selections are stored in the database Master List, so there is a single instance of each. 

When adding a selection to your squadron, you wil select it from the Master List. If it does not exist in your database, you will first create it in the Master List, then assign it to your squadron. To add a selection of, for example, 1A150 to DAFSC: 

**1. ** Select DAFSC in the Tables grid. 

**2. ** In the Listings grid, view a list of DAFSCs already assigned to your squadron. 

**3. ** Right-click and select Add. 

**4. ** The Master List opens, showing all DAFSCs in the database. 

**5. ** If the desired DAFSC appears, check it and click OK \(or Apply\). 

**6. ** If the desired DAFSC does not appear, 

**A. ** Right-click in the Master List dialog and select Add. 

398 

**B. ** In the open Duty AF Specialty Code field, type in the required DAFSC, \(in this case 1A150\), check it and click OK. 

**7. ** 1A150 appears in the DAFSC Table list, and will now appear in the DAFSC dropdowns. 



**Setup - Configure Personnel for your unit **

**Configure the display **

In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the display area and select Grid Settings. Set number of people to display on a one-page view in Records per page field \(set 999 to see all\), then select Font size. Check the columns to display, then Save. The columns may be moved by left-mouse click/hold and drag on the column header. When the display is set, right-click and click Save Layout. 

The other tabs work the same way. 

**Page Settings **

Click the Page Settings icon at upper-right and select Labels. Label Manager allows Grid Column Default Labels to be overridden with a custom label. For example, if there is a column you do not use, you could re-label it and use it to track something else. Close the module to save changes. Click 

“Legend”; the Φ symbol indicates fields that are overwritten with each ARMS import. This is important to consider for data entry; a manual entry in an ARMS field will be retained until the next ARMS import \(usually daily\) overwrites it. 

**Manage the Personnel list **

Click the funnel icon next to Page Settings to open the filter tool. The list can be narrowed-down by Crew Position, Flight, etc. An applied filter must be de-selected \(click Clear Filter\) to restore the full squadron list. 

**Customize Dropdown Lists **

In the Personnel > Setup tab, select the selections you need in your squadron's dropdown lists. This is described in Personnel > Personnel Details by tab > Setup.  If you are setting up more than one squadron, you can create the list in one squadron, then send to others. 

**1. ** For each Table, right-click in the Listings grid and select View/Edit Master List. When it opens you can see which entries already exist in your database and which need to be added. 

**2. ** Edit lists as desired. 

**3. ** For each list, right-click in the Listings grid and select Send To. 

**4. ** When the dialog opens, select the squadrons to receive your list. 

**5. ** Click Send To. 

**6. ** Go to those squadrons and confirm your lists transferred correctly. 

**Populate with your squadron's personnel **

**1. ** See Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel for options. 

399 

Setup 

**2. ** Assign an MDS to each person. 

**NOTE:** If this is a new squadron and your are adding an MDS for the first time, when you click off the row to save the first-added MDS, PEX will ask if you to assign that MDS to the remaining people in the squadron. This is the only point at which you have the option to mass-assign the MDS in that squadron. 

**3. ** Assign crew position\(s\) as required. 

**Add, Move, Import and Export Personnel **

**Transfer Personnel data **

■ Personnel data can be added to PEX by: 

• \(I\) Adding a person manual y. 

• \(II\) Importing people or a person with an ARMS file. 

• \(III\) Importing individual personnel files from another PEX database. 

■ \(IV\) Exporting personnel information as a personnel file, and the file sent to another unit for import into their PEX database. 

■ \(V\) Moving personnel information from one squadron to another squadron within the same PEX database. 

**Personnel information import, export and move general information **

The following rules govern personnel exports, imports and moves. 

■ **Personnel data. ** Most personnel data moves: Names, Date of Birth,Gender, Rank, Civilian Grade, AFSC, Duty AFSC, Passport Number, Separation Date and Special Experience Identifiers. 

■ **MDS/CP Qualifications. ** All Quals in Personnel are exported. If the gaining squadron has matching MDS and CP, Quals are imported. 

■ **Certifications \(Letter of X.\)** All certifications are exported as they are setup in the losing squadron’s LoX. If the gaining squadron has matching Cert Name, MDS, CrewPosition and Status, then the certs import and are applied to the person. Non-matching LoXs are stored in database and are included in any future exports. 

■ **Continuation Training Events. ** Al Unit Level tasks are exported, but they must be approved and audited \(if auditing required\). If the gaining squadron has matching Training Events \(Task Code, Task Name, Program Codes\) person is assigned the event. Non-matching events are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. These non-matching tasks can be viewed in the CT module. ARMS tasks are not exported as they can be imported into the gaining database through the normal ARMS import process. 

■ **Qualification Training Courses. ** All data is exported \(Historic Courses and Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs\) but Courses must first be marked complete. Courses that are marked complete and their associated MFRs become historic after import. 

400 

■ **Qualification Training Task Lists. ** Open Task Lists move with all signatures and dates from the previous database. Form 623a Entries, CFETP Task Lists, Historic Training Programs, Memos For Record, Person Training Documents, Scanned MFRs move. 

■ **Stan Eval. ** All data is exported \(Certification Scans, Qualification Certificate Scans, Qualification Certificate Images, Record of Evaluation Scans, Memo for Record Images, Memo For Record Scans, Certifications, Person Crew Quals, Major Discrepancy Scans, Major Discrepancy Images, Minor Discrepancy Scans, Minor Discrepancies\), but all MFRs and Major Discrepancies must be signed. Export is al owed with an open evaluation but the open evaluation itself is not exported. 

■ **FCIF. ** Al FCIFs/IRFs are exported, but are subject to “exact match” rules upon import. Type, Number, and Subject must match exactly. Non-matching FCIFs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. 

■ **SEI. ** Al SEIs are exported, but are subject to “exact match” rules upon import. Non-matching SEIs are stored in the database and are included in any future exports. 

■ **Exams. ** Exam data does not move and PEX does not prevent an export if the person has open exams. Completed evaluation requisite exam data moves, as part of the evaluation. 

■ **Permission Roles. ** Roles do not move. 

**\(I\) Add a person manually **

**1. ** In the Personnel tab: 

**A. ** Right-click in the Personnel tab, select Add, and you are taken to the Details tab. 

**B. ** Click on the Details tab. 

**2. ** Ensure you have the person's assigned squadron selected in the Fly Sq dropdown. 

**3. ** **Required**: In the Details grid, enter a Short Name for the person. Typically, this is Firstname.Lastname \(Ellen.Ripley\) or LastnameFirstnameinitial \(RipleyE\). Although not required, this Short Name often matches the person's User Name in Users and Permissions. We recommend using the same naming convention for al personnel. 

**4. ** **Required**: Enter the person's ID \#. Typically, this is the person's social security number but can be any nine-digit number. This number must be unique in the database. If the number is not unique PEX displays an alert informing you of which squadron contains a person with that ID number. 

**5. ** Save. 

**A. ** Click Save & New to add another person. 

**B. ** Click Save to save the entered required information and continue adding to the person's information.

Setup 

**7. ** If the person needs a User Account \(to enable login to PEX\), you can now go to Users and Permissions and create the account. 

**\(I \) Import people or a person with an ARMS file **

This is covered in detail in ARMS- Configure your PEX-ARMS Interface.  

**1. ** Configure the ARMS - PEX interface in Continuation Training > ARMS. This involves adding your unit's 17-character unit identifier so PEX can match that identifier to the PEX squadron. 

**2. ** Extract your unit's personnel data from ARMS and save as a .csv file. Save the file to an accessible location on your computer or network. 

**3. ** Import the file in Continuation Training > ARMS. 

**4. ** Check the log file for any errors. 

**5. ** Go to Setup > Personnel > Personnel tab and confirm any new people were successful y added. 

**6. ** For the newly added personnel, go to Setup > Personnel > Quals tab and assign an MDS. 

**\(I I\) Import individual personnel files from another PEX database **

This assumes you have received the person's data file from the losing unit and saved it to an accessible location on your computer or network. The naming convention is LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata. 

**1. ** In the Personnel tab, right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select Import/Export > Import Personnel Data. 

**2. ** When the Import Personnel Data dialog opens, browse to the .pexdata file. 

**3. ** Click Begin Import. 

**A. ** If the personnel record does not already exist, it wil be created. 

**B. ** If the personnel record already exists, you will be given a warning that the all existing data will be overwritten and the opportunity to cancel the operation. The import brings in Unit Tasks, if there are matching Unit Tasks; FCIFs, if there are matching FCIFs; and SEIs, if there are matching SEIs. 

**4. ** View the import log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Import Person Logs. Successful imports have a green check, unsuccessful imports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. 

**\(IV\) Export personnel data as a personnel file **

**1. ** In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person and select Import/Export > Export Personnel Data 

**2. ** When the Export Personnel Data dialog opens, click Begin Export. 

**A. ** If there are any outstanding issues that need to be resolved, PEX will inform you \(open training, open evaluations, open PEX courses, or unsigned MFRs\). 

**B. ** View the export log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Export Logs Personnel Data. Successful exports have a green check, 402 

unsuccessful exports have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. 

**3. ** Save the resulting file \(LastnameFirstinitial.pexdata\) and send it to the gaining unit. 

**4. ** After exporting a person’s data you should move them to your inactive \(PCS\) squadron. See the Change Squadron topic below. 

We recommend you add a step in your out-processing checklists to accomplish this export. 

**\(V\) Move personnel data from one squadron to another squadron \(Change** **Squadron\) **

People may be moved to another squadron in the same PEX database as long as they have no open training tasks \(approve/export them\), no open qualification courses \(close out or un-enroll\) or unsigned MFRs. 

**1. ** In the Personnel tab, right-click on the person you want to move and select Change Squadron. 

**2. ** In the dialog, note the correct person’s name is selected. You can check/add more people at this point. 

**3. ** Select the destination squadron from the list 

**4. ** Click Change Squadron for Personnel, and Yes at the confirmation dialog. 

**5. ** A progress indicator will launch. 

**6. ** View the change log file as desired; right-click anywhere in the Personnel grid and select View Logs > View Change Squadron Logs. Successful moves have a green check, unsuccessful moves have a red exclamation point. Click the person's name to open the actual log file for more information. 

**Personnel TTPs **

**MDS and Crew Position **

**MDSs **are setup in the Maintenance > Aircraft module. For your MDS to appear in the Personnel module, it must be identified in Setup > Squadrons > Display MDS in Dropdowns column. 

**Crew Positions** are setup in Setup > Personnel > Setup > Crew Position.  The selected squadron’s list displays. Right-click to Add or Delete. Qual Codes are managed the same way through the Aircrew Qualification Code page. 

**Assign a Crew Position to a person. ** For ARMS units, this is done through the ARMS import. Qual Codes are assigned the same way. For non-ARMS units, on the Quals tab, select from the dropdown list in Crew Pos and Qual Code fields, click off the line to Save. 

**Assign an MDS **by going to the Quals tab and selecting the person. Click in the MDS field and select the MDS. Click off the line to Save. People may be assigned multiple MDSs but only one can be marked as Primary. 

**The bare minimum. ** Assign a single MDS/CP to a person. 

**1. ** If the person accomplishes duties in other MDS/CP combinations, those should also be added. For example, the person may be qualified in different CPs in the same MDS. Each of 403 

Setup 

those should get a separate line item. The person may be qualified in the same CP in multiple MDSs. Each of those should get a separate line item. 

**2. ** For each MDS/CP line item, identify characteristics such as: Qual Code, Experience, Weather Category, etc. These characteristics go along with the person’s MDS/CP qualification, not just the person. 

**How users can view and update their own information **

Anyone with a user account can view their personnel data and update their contact information. On My Page click the My Personal Data link. Users can view their data in the Details, Duties, Contact, Qual and Status tabs. They can add, edit and delete Addresses, Phone Numbers, and Email Addresses on the Contact tab. We suggest that personnel login to PEX at regular intervals and keep this information updated, especially the home email addresses, as this is where PEX sends notifications of scheduling changes, assigned exams, assigned evaluations, and late requisites. 

**Remove a person leaving your unit **

When moving people to another database \(e.g., PCS\), as opposed to moving people from one squadron to another within the same database \(e.g., PCA\), that person's data file is exported and sent to the gaining unit. We recommend that the losing unit, instead of attempting to delete the person, move them to an inactive squadron in their unit's database. That squadron is created locally and is often called "PCS" or similar. This way their personnel record is still retrievable if necessary. 

Simply follow the instructions for Move a person from one squadron to another \(Change Squadron\), selecting the inactive squadron. 

**Guest Flyers **

For “Guest Flyers”, add them as normal, then check the block for Do Not Export 781 Data and enter their home base HARM 781 Flying Orgn. When exporting 781s, their data will not export, even though they are on the 781. 

**Build Unit Task Codes \(UTC\) in PEX **

UTCs may be built in PEX and exported to Excel for further manipulation and data entry. 

**3. ** Go to Setup > Personnel > Setup, click Unit Task Code from the list **4. ** First, configure the grid: right-click, select Grid Settings, de-select all un-needed columns. 

Then, left-click, hold/drag columns to desired placement. Right-click, Save Layout. 

**5. ** Right-click Add the UTC and ULNs 

**6. ** The ULN, if single-digit, must be preceded by “0” 

**7. ** Title \(or Role\) is free-text entry 

**8. ** Squadron auto-fills with Unassigned 

**9. ** Select Rank and PAFSC\(s\) 

**Create in Excel. ** Right-click, select Export to Excel. Delete the Unassigned values in the Squadron column. This Excel sheet can now be fil ed with the names and squadrons of the actual people assigned to the deployment. 

404 

**More than one UTC. ** Add them al to PEX. Export the entire list to Excel and delete \(in Excel\) the undesired UTC records. 

**Handle Inbound Deployed Personnel in your PEX Database **

Let’s say you have a PEX database already in use at your base. Now some deployed personnel join your unit temporarily, such as an exercise or to sit alert. You can add them to PEX so that they can be scheduled and tracked for No-Go. 

**1. Contact the person’s home unit and obtain: **

**A. ** A list of the person’s Letter of X certifications. 

**B. ** An extract, for just that person, of the unit’s Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files from the PEX browsers . 

**2. ** **Append .CSV files. ** Open the Personnel .CSV extract file for the deployed person. Copy the data line\(s\) from the extract \(not the header line\). Open your unit's Personnel .CSV file and scroll to the bottom of the file. Paste the extract data beneath the last data line of the .CSV file and save. Repeat the steps for both the Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files. 

**3. ** **Import the .CSV extracts. ** Go to training > Continuation > ARMS > Settings and ensure your squadron is selected. In the Squadrons & ARMS Unit Identifiers field set, in the “Add ARMS unit to import into selected PEX squadron:” text box, type in the 9-character ARMS unit code from the person’s Personnel Flying Hours .CSV file and click Add. Then type in the 17-character ARMS 

unit code from the person’s Training.CSV file and click Add. In the .CSV File field set, browse to your unit's appended Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours .CSV files and click Save. 

Go to the Import view, and import Personnel, Training and Personnel Flying Hours into your squadron. 

**Note:** In order to export this person’s AFTO 781 flying hours and training tasks back into ARMS, you wil need permissions to the person’s home station ARMS database. Usually, you will not have these permissions. 

**4. ** **Add Personnel Details. ** Go to Setup > Personnel > Details, select the new person, and add the following data: Arrival \(date\) and Departure \(date\). Assign the person a supervisor, if appropriate. 

**5. ** **Add Quals & Certs**. Go to Setup > Personnel > Quals & Certs, and assign the person an MDS/Crew Position/WX Cat/Msn Ready Status \(5.7\+\)/Experience \(5.7\+\). Assign any Letter of X 

certifications that are applicable to your mission and organization.\(Assigning an MDS/Crew Position will automatically assign this person all the FCIFs for that MDS/Crew Position. It also makes them available for flight scheduling.\) 

**6. ** **Add Personnel Duties. ** Go to Setup > Personnel > Duties, and assign Pri Exp Ind \(5.6-\) and Msn Rdy Status \(5.6-\). Check the box “Do Not Export 781 Data”, enter the person’s 781 Flying ORGN \(can be bogus\), and Save. 

**7. ** **Verify Applicable FCIFs are assigned. ** Go to Ops > FCIF and filter for that person’s MDS/Crew Position to verify the person shows up in the list and is assigned all the appropriate FCIFs. 

**8. ** **Assign Required Unit Level Tasks. ** Go to Training > Continuation > Unit Task Assignment and assign the person any Unit Tasks required by your unit. 

405 

Setup 

**9. ** **Verify Personnel Flying Hours Status. ** Go to Scheduling > Reports > Personnel Flying Hours and run the report to make sure the new person shows up in the list. Note any potential problem with high flying time that might arise and develop a plan to manage it. 

**10. ** **Verify Training Tasks Status. ** Go to Training > Continuation > Training Tasks, ensure your squadron is selected, and click the “Clear Filter” button in the top right of the screen if it is in view. Verify the person you just imported is listed. At the top left of the screen, change the date to the person’s scheduled Departure Date from step 3 above. Note al the training events that will go overdue while the person is deployed to your location and develop a plan to keep the person current on the ones that matter to you. 

**PEX User Login. ** If you want the person to be able to login to PEX for viewing the schedule, entering and acknowledging commitments, taking exams, etc.: 

**1. ** Ensure the person has a Windows account to log on to the computers. 

**2. ** Add a PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Users and add the person as a PEX User. 

**3. ** Associate the PEX Users Account to the Windows Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Windows Accounts and associate the PEX User you just added to the person’s Windows account. \(Assigning the person a PEX user account wil al ow them to sign off PEX 

FCIFs.\) 

**4. ** Associate Permissions to the PEX User Account. Go to Setup > Users & Permissions > Permissions and make sure the person has the permissions required for duty \(at least Basic User to the squadron\). 

**5. ** Assign Exams. Go to Stan Eval > Testing Admin > Exam > Assigned Exams and assign the person all the appropriate tests. 

■ This checklist is based on the assumption that no formal upgrades or evaluations are conducted on the inbound deployed person. If that is not the case, the person would need to be assigned to a PEX Qualification Training course and/or assigned a PEX Stan Eval evaluation. 

■ Aircraft. If the personnel bring their own airplanes, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft and add the MDS, if not already listed. Fill in the ARMS MDS field. Select the squadron the airplane belongs to, add the tail number\(s\) \(fil in the ARMS ID\) and select any squadrons that may share the tail number. 

■ Redeployment. When the person leaves, go to Setup > Personnel and change the person’s Fly Sq to the “PCS” squadron or equivalent. If you don’t have a PCS squadron in PEX, go to Setup 

> Squadrons and add it. When the aircraft leaves, go to Maintenance > Aircraft > Aircraft > Tail Number, uncheck any Shared Squadrons, uncheck the box for “Show in Dropdown” and change the Squadron to PCS. 

**Reports **

**Reports Overview **

**Introduction **

Currently, most functional areas \(Scheduling, Training, etc.\) include a Reports module, containing all forms and reports for that function. Starting in 5.16, these will be progressively replaced by Rapid 406 

!(images/000092.jpg)

Reports/Reporting functionality. The legacy Reports modules will remain in place until the transition is complete. Currently, these reports pull data only from legacy modules. 

Rapid Reports are official USAF forms, standardized reports, and unit-customized reports. Units can request unit-customized reports from the PEX Program Office. All reports are in Dynamic Link Library \(DLL\) file format and can be downloaded from the PEX website or sent from the PEX help desk. Once imported, USAF forms can be opened in PDF format, while reports can be opened in PDF or Excel formats. 

The Setup > Reports module functions as the reports manager. Downloaded reports are imported into PEX through this module. Once imported, reports appear in the appropriate modules. Reports can be deleted when no longer required. 

Reports currently in development include: 

■ AF Form 4327 

■ AF Form 4327a 

■ AFTO Form 781 

■ Bomber Scheduling Report 

■ Fighter Scheduling Report 

■ Recon Scheduling Report 

■ RPA Schedule 

■ Missile Operations Personnel Schedule

**Resources **

**Resources Basics **

**Introduction **

Configuring the Resources module allows you tailor and streamline your scheduling processes by categorizing and grouping resources. 

**Resources** are people, places and things that can be scheduled in the Scheduler. 

**Resource** **Types** are categories of resources, such as people, airspace and aircraft. 

408 

!(images/000057.jpg)

**Resource** **Groups** are collections of resources. 

The actual resources are added to PEX in their respective modules; People in Personnel, Airspace in Locations, Aircraft in Maintenance, etc. In the Resources module, you first associate resources to a resource type, then associate resources to one or more groups. For example, you can create a hard crew group with four persons, then schedule them as a group instead of individual y, similar to Crew Sets in legacy scheduling modules. 

**Controls **

Access these procedures by navigating to Setup > Resources. 

**Module Notes **

■ A resource group consists of a single type of resource. For example, a Group can contain Persons or Workstations, but not Persons and Workstations. 

■ Resources are used only in the Scheduler module. They do not apply to legacy scheduling modules.

**Squadrons **

**Squadrons Basics **

**Introduction **

The Squadrons module identifies units in the PEX database that wil be used throughout PEX, to define Availability Periods for these squadrons, and to register the squadrons with HQ for scheduling and training data rol ups. Access to data throughout PEX is control ed by squadron and user. 

**Permissions **

The PEXAdmin and Administrator permission roles can access Squadrons. 

**Rules **

■ While Administrator can add a squadron, only PEXAdmin can delete a squadron. 

■ A squadron can have only a single set of \(up to\) six Availability Periods active at one time. 

**Module Notes **

■ A new squadron wil not display in other PEX modules until you log out and back in. 

■ When a squadron is added; initially, the only users with permissions to that squadron will be the user that added it and the master user account, PexAdmin. 

**Workspace **

These features are accessed by navigating to Setup > Squadrons.

connection and wish to export readiness data. Otherwise leave it unchecked. 



**Squadrons Availability Periods **

Availability** **periods, up to six, are used to describe blocks of time where personnel can identify when they are available to be scheduled. These periods are identified by the schedulers. Then, part-time personnel \(think ANG and AFRC\) can identify when they are available using those periods. The periods can overlap. 

Example periods are: 

■ Period: 00:00 – 23:59 

413 

!(images/000106.jpg)

Setup 

■ Periods \(AM, PM, and Night\): 05:00-12:00, 11:00-18:00, 17:00-23:59 

**Enter your squadron’s Availability Periods **

**1. ** Highlight the Squadron in the Squadron’s grid 

**2. ** Place the cursor in the Availability Periods grid, right-click and select Add. An Add Availability Period dialog will appear. 

**3. ** Set the number of periods and set the start/end time for each period. Periods can \(and usually do\) overlap. For example, if you end one period at 09:00 and start the next at 09:01, it creates a gap of one minute and PEX will think personnel are unavailable for that one minute. 

Using this example, you should end the first period at 09:00 and start the second at 09:00. 

Periods can run from 00:00 to 23:59 \(they cannot cross midnight\). 

**4. ** Click OK when finished. There can be up to six periods identified for a squadron. 

**NOTE. ** Once saved, the periods cannot be edited. Instead, new Availability Periods set must be created to replace the old. Personnel and schedulers can use only the latest set for data entry. Old sets are displayed for historical purposes.

wil advise when to use this and supply the data required. 





**1. ** Select **Register Squadron** to open the dialog. All field entries in this dialog are required. 

**2. ** In the **Info Type** dropdown, select the data to register: Scheduling or Training. 

**NOTE:** If you want to do both, two registrations must be added. 

**3. ** In the **Squadron** drop down, select the squadron to register. 

**4. ** Enter the **MAJCOM. ** 

**5. ** Enter the MAJCOM **URL** \(provided by MAJCOM\). 

**6. ** **Point of Contact**. Enter the MAJCOM POC's Name, Phone Number, and Email. You can overwrite the default POC if you chose to. 

**7. ** With all fields complete, select **Save**. Once saved, a new row entry appears indicating Squadron selected, MAJCOM Approval Status - "Waiting". 

414 

**8. ** Once saved, the MAJCOM must approve the registration. When the Registration is approved, MAJCOM Approval Status changes to - "Approved". Your squadron is now successfully registered and ready to start sending CT and/or Scheduling data. 

**9. ** Upon initial Approval, the "Last Sync Date" column will be blank until scheduled or manual Sync's are accomplished. 

**TaskView - Import an Airspace Control Order \(ACO\) **

**Introduction **

The TaskView Interface reads an Airspace Control Order \(\*.aco\) file and imports ACO locations into the PEX database. The ACO data retrieved includes the airspace type, name, latitude/longitude, and valid times. Once imported, the data retrieved from the ACO creates a new location in the Locations module. 

**Import an ACO **

The following steps assume the ACO file has been downloaded and saved to an accessible location on your computer. Typically, the ACO, along with the ATO \(Air Tasking Order\), are downloaded from a website or another application. 

Go to Setup > TaskView > TaskView Import tab > Import Section. 

In the ACO Input File selection box, browse to the ACO file, and click Display Data. PEX displays the ACO Start Date/Time \(Z\) and End Date/Time \(Z\), and all ACM Types and Locations in the selected file. 

Enter the path for where you want the Log File stored. 

Select the ACM Types and/or Locations you want to import into PEX and click the Send button. With these ACO locations now in your database, you can use them to build missions and sortie events. 

Once in the PEX database, ACO locations can be used just like PEX, PFPS, and ATO locations. 

**Managing Imported Locations **

The imported locations can be viewed and, if necessary, edited in the Locations module by selecting Source: ACO, and clicking Display Data. 

ACO locations may import without latitude/longitude. If so, manually enter lat/long as required. 

Zulu offsets and Daylight Saving Time \(DST\) offsets are not entered for ACO locations. For accurate local times at the ACO locations, manually enter the Zulu and DST offsets. If you are scheduling in Zulu only, there should be no need to enter Zulu and DST offsets for the ACO locations. For more, see Setup > Locations.  

**Users and Permissions **

**Users and Permissions Basics **

**Introduction **

Users and Permissions allows administrators to manage who can log in to PEX \(Users\), what those people can do in PEX \(Permissions\), and how they can log in \(CAC or Windows\). User accounts can one of two types. 

**1. ** An individual account, allowing a person log in and view their information in PEX. 

415 

Setup 

**2. ** A joint-use account, which can be used by multiple people. Because multiple people can use it, joint-use accounts cannot be associated to a Personnel record. 

**Permissions **

Users with Administrator permission to any squadron can access this page. However, they can see only those squadrons to which they have permission. 

**Rules **

■ Users cannot change their own permissions. That must be done by PEXAdmin. 

■ Multiple people can be associated to the PEXAdmin user account. 

■ Users can be assigned the role of Administrator in individual squadrons. 

■ People assigned the Administrator role should be trained and experienced PEX users. 

■ Every squadron should have at least two people assigned the Administrator role. 

**Workspace **

****

**1. ** **Users**. Add User accounts for people who need to log in to PEX. Associate them to Personnel records so they can see their information. 

**2. ** **Permissions**. Grant users the level of access required to perform their duties in PEX. 

**3. ** **CAC Accounts**. Allow users to log in with a Common Access Card \(CAC\). This is useful when users cannot log in via an AFNet account. 

**4. ** **Windows Accounts**. Al ow users to log in with a Windows domain account. This is the most common method. 

**5. ** **Joint-use accounts**. These are not associated to an individual. 

**6. ** **Individual accounts**. These are associated to individual Personnel records. 

**NOTE**: Although not normal y required, users can be associated to both CAC and Windows logins if desired. 

**Workflow **





**Manage User Accounts **

**Create Permission templates **

Create Permission templates to apply to new users: 

**1. ** Go to Users and Permissions > Permissions tab. 

**2. ** Check the Basic User role for your squadron. 

**3. ** Click Save as New Template and call it “Basic User \(squadron name\)”. 

416 

**4. ** Repeat as required for various combinations of roles and squadrons. 

**Add a User account **

**1. ** Go to Users and Permissions > Users tab. 

**2. ** Right-click and select Add User. 

**3. ** In the Add User dialog, select the desired Default Template. 

**4. ** Enter your email extension, e.g., @us.af.mil. 

**5. ** Select your email convention, e.g., First.Last 

**6. ** Person Associated. 

**A. ** For individual person accounts, associate the user account to a Personnel record. If the person will accomplish activities in PEX \(scheduled for commitments, training folder, Stan Eval folder, etc.\), ensure they have a Personnel record in the Personnel module. Skip this step if the person will not accomplish activities in PEX but only login to PEX to see information \(Air Traffic Control, Base Operations, Inflight Kitchen, etc.\) For Joint Use Accounts, skip to User Details. 

**B. ** Select the squadron to which the person is assigned. 

**C. ** Select their Short Name from the dropdown. This list includes all persons who have a Personnel record but do not have a user account. 

**7. ** User Details. PEX populates these fields. Make any desired changes to: **A. ** User Name 

**B. ** Email 

**C. ** Full Name 

**D. ** Loc. Use a Source of PEX and your Location, e.g., “KVPS” 

**E. ** For Joint Use Accounts, check Joint Use Acct. If this account is associated to a person, the check box is disabled. 

**8. ** Click Save. PEX will send an email to the new user informing them of the account and how to login. 

**9. ** Adjust the person's permission roles if required. See Manage Permission Roles. 

**10. ** Associate the new user to their CAC or Windows account. See CAC and Windows Associations. 

**Find users not logging in **

**1. ** Go to Users tab, right-click and select Filter By Last Login. 

**2. ** In the dialog, select a time span and click OK. 

**3. ** The resulting list is those users that have not logged in for that amount of time. To return to the complete user list, right-click, and select Edit Applied Last Login Filter, select No Filter, and click OK. 

**Delete an account **

417 

Setup 

**1. ** Go to Users tab, highlight the name, right-click and select Delete. 

**2. ** Deleting a User account does not delete any data about the Person. All scheduling, training, Stan Eval, etc. data is retained. 

**3. ** Multiple accounts can be deleted simultaneously by using the Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple users. 

**Lock out a user from PEX **

This prevents users from logging in. 

**1. ** Go to Users tab. 

**2. ** On the User name, right-click and select Lock User. 

**3. ** To unlock, right-click and select Unlock User. 

**Manage Permission Roles **

Squadron Administrators apply Permission Roles for individual PEX Users based on the duties performed in the unit. Grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the duties. Grant the top-level Administrator role only if required to access the Users and Permissions module. The Administrator role has permissions to all modules in PEX, not just the administrative ones. Each squadron should have at least two Administrators. 

**View all Users in a Role **

**1. ** On the Permissions tab, highlight the Role Name, e.g., Administrator. 

**2. ** Right-click and select See Users In Role. 

**3. ** The Users in \(selected\) Role dialog opens showing all users in that role. 

**Change a user’s permissions **

Every User Account starts with a set of permissions. If you need to edit these permissions: **1. ** Go to the Permissions tab and highlight the User 

**2. ** The user's assigned permissions appear under the squadron column\(s\). 

**3. ** Check and un-check roles and squadrons as required. 

**4. ** Click Apply Permissions. 

**Save a User’s permissions as a template for others **

**1. ** Go to the Permissions tab and highlight the user who has the permissions from whom you want to create a template. That User's permissions will show up in the Users Permissions Grid. 

**2. ** Click Save as New Template. 

**3. ** Give the template a name \(e.g., Basic User, Stan Eval\) and select Save. 

**4. ** The Template will now be available to apply when adding a new user, or editing existing users. 

418 

**Create a Template from Scratch **

**1. ** Go to the Permissions tab and ensure no user is selected on the left and no boxes are checked. You may need to leave the module and come back. 

**2. ** Select the desired Roles for the desired squadrons in the Users Permissions Grid by checking the appropriate boxes. 

**3. ** Select Save as New Template, give the template a name, and select Save. 

**4. ** The Template will now be available to apply when adding a new user, or editing existing users. 

**Apply a Template to existing User **

**1. ** Go to the Permissions tab. 

**2. ** In the Users grid, select the user to whom you want to apply the template. 

**3. ** Click Select Template. 

**4. ** When the dialog opens, select the template you want and click OK. 

**5. ** The new permissions will be displayed in the Users Permissions Grid, with the name of the template in the grid header. 

**6. ** Select Apply Template. A warning will come up saying the current permission roles will be overwritten. Click OK to apply the template. 

**CAC and Windows Associations **

Use the CAC or the Windows Accounts tab to associate user accounts to their CAC or Windows account so they can login to PEX. 

**Associate a user to their CAC **

**1. ** Go to the CAC Accounts tab 

**2. ** In the CAC Accounts Available grid, right-click and select Add CAC Account to PEX 

**3. ** In the dialog, enter the person’s CAC Number and name from the CAC \(not PEX User Name\) **4. ** Click OK and select the CAC you just entered 

**5. ** In the Users grid, find the User Name and select it \(right-click Filter Grid will prove useful\) **6. ** With a User and CAC selected, click the Associate CAC Account\(s\) button. The user will now be able to login to PEX via their CAC. 

**Associate a user to their Windows account **

If your unit does not use CACs, associate your Users to their Windows accounts. If you associated the user to a CAC you should skip these steps. 

**1. ** Go to the Windows Accounts tab 

**2. ** In the Windows Accounts Available grid, right-click and select Add CAC Account to PEX 

419 

Setup 

**3. ** Click the Find By Email button 

**4. ** Enter the person’s email address and click the Find button. This should auto-fill the Windows Account and Domain Names. Click OK and select the CAC you just entered. 

**5. ** In the Users grid, find the User Name and select it \(right-click Filter Grid will prove useful\) **6. ** With a User and Windows account selected, click the Associate Windows Account\(s\) button. 

The user will now be able to login to PEX via their Windows account. 

**Joint Use Accounts **

A single Joint Use \(PEX User\) account can be associated to multiple CAC or Windows accounts. This way, multiple people could login to the “Base Ops” PEX user account, for example.

**Validation **

The Validation module is used to standardize drop-down lists in three scheduling modules: Mission Board, Commitments Board, and Personnel Availability. 

**Configure Validation **

The screen opens with two areas: "Tables", and "Listings", and a Squadron selector: 

■ Tables is subdivided into Mission Board, Commitments Board, and Personnel Availability. The entries within each sub-area correspond to drop-down lists in those modules. 

■ Listings displays the entries that appear in the drop-down lists. The Listings are modifiable by squadron and can be sent from one squadron to another. 

**Add, edit and delete Table entries **

To edit the list of entries, select a squadron, expand the appropriate sub-area in the Tables list, and select the desired drop-down list \(table\). To add a new entry, right-click within the Listing grid and select Add. A Master Grid list of entries already in the database but not used by your squadron wil appear. If one of these is the desired entry, check the box to the left of the entry and click OK. If the desired entry is not in the list, right-click in the grid and select Add. To delete an entry, right-click on it and select Delete. This simply removes it from your squadron list but is retained on the Master List. To edit an entry, click directly on the field and edit. 

**When you first add a squadron to PEX **

When a squadron is added to PEX, it copies the Unassigned squadron’s validation entries into the new squadron. This reduces the time required to build a squadron’s set of validation data. If you have a multi-squadron base and want quicker setup, edit all the validation tables for the Unassigned squadron first before adding your real squadrons. 

**Share Listings across squadrons **

Right-click and select Send To. Select the check-box for the squadron\(s\) you wish to send the item\(s\) to and select Send Selected Items. NOTE: you must have permission \(Ops Desk, Flight Scheduling, Ground Scheduling, or Flying Hours\) to the other squadron\(s\) in order to Send To. 

**How the Sortie Type table differs **

In addition to just the simple list of the sortie types used by your unit, use this table to identify: **1. ** Whether this sortie type is a “RAP” sortie, for counting scheduled RAP sorties **2. ** The Average Sortie Duration \(ASD\), for the Flying Hours module **3. ** The default Standard Configuration Load \(SCL\), for auto-scheduling the SCL 

**4. ** The Risk Value \(1 = Low to 10 = High\), for the ORM module **How the Personnel Commitment Types table differs **

Personnel Commitment Types can be set to conflict \(or not\) with shifts. Normal y, when two commitments conflict, you would like PEX to warn you that someone is about to be double-scheduled. However, Shifts work a little differently. Many times, personnel are scheduled onto shifts in order for them to be scheduled for other activities during that shift. In those cases, the other commitments do not conflict with the shift, they are, instead, an integral part of the shift and you 435 

Setup 

don’t want PEX bringing up nuisance warnings. Use this table to mark those Personnel Commitment Types that do indeed conflict with a Shift, such as another Shift, or a Sortie, or TDY. 

**Getting Started for PEX Administrators **

If you are setting up PEX for the first time, you will find the following general instructions useful. If PEX is already setup and you are a new PEX administrator, the following will give you a good idea of what has already been done. Detailed instructions on al the steps below can be found in the PEX 

built-in help and/or user manual. The PEX Database Manager has its own built-in help and user manual. 

**1. ** The first step to using PEX is to install the PEX Database Manager and PEX Service Host applications on the SQL server that wil host your data. Use the Database Manager to instal a real-world Release database that will host your data. The PEX database is the center of all PEX 

operations. It contains all the data. For details on installing the PEX Database Manager and PEX 

Service Host, see the PEX Instal ation Guide. 

**2. ** After the database is installed, use the Database Manager to associate CACs/Windows Accounts to PexAdmin and to normal PEX users. 

**3. ** After the database is installed on a network server or a stand-alone desktop/laptop computer, install the: 

**A. ** WinPEX software on all the machines that need access to the PEX Mission Board \(flight scheduling\). All other modules can be accessed via ePEX. 

**B. ** ePEX on a web-server and add a hyperlink on your unit home page to ePEX. 

**4. ** Launch the Locations module. Add your location, e.g., KVPS. With the location selected, enter the appropriate offset from GMT and a corresponding DST Rule. 

**5. ** Launch the Users and Permissions module. NOTE that an initial User “PexAdmin” has been added. Highlight the PexAdmin line and select a Default Location Source of “PEX.” Then select the location entered in step 4 above as the Default Location. 

**6. ** Launch the Squadrons module and add the units/squadrons that wil be using PEX plus a 

"PCS" squadron to which you wil eventual y move people that have left your unit. 

**7. ** Once the squadrons are entered, personnel data can be added through the ARMS Interface or manual y through the Personnel module. 

**8. ** If your unit does not use ARMS, in the Personnel module, Setup tab, pick a unit and customize your lists. Once you are done with one squadron, you can use the right-click "Send To" command to copy the lists over to other units. 

**9. ** In the Personnel module, add your personnel manual y. 

**10. ** Launch the Aircraft module and enter your aircraft MDSs and tail numbers. 

**11. ** In the Users & Permissions module, assign other PEX users and grant them levels of access to the various PEX applications. 

**12. ** Your unit is now ready to begin using PEX.

!(images/000080.jpg)

**Miscellaneous **

**Visibility Model **

Originally, units created data items \(FCIF, MDS or eval type, for example\) in each squadron. Although they appear the same, each item is a separate instance in the database. This created redundancies and complicated moving people between squadrons. The visibility model handles this by creating a single database instance of the item. The user then selects which squadrons have visibility to the item. However… 

**WARNINGs: **

■ Changing the item will affect all squadrons with visibility to that item. For example, your database has an Eval Requisite of “Vis Recce” and visibility is selected for multiple squadrons. 

If you change the item to “Visual Recce” it will appear as such in al squadrons, not just yours. 

This includes squadrons using the item to which you may not have permission. 

■ Because these edits can break data standards for a community which, in turn, negatively impact seamless data transition during Personnel export/import and squadron changes, any edits to Visibility data entries should be coordinated with the database PEX Admin and all using squadrons. 

■ In this example, the database has a single instance of the Eval Type "TAC." The 11RS, 130IS, 132IS and 742MS do not have visibility to TAC. The 80FS and 165AS do have visibility to TAC. 

If someone in the 80FS changes TAC to TACTICAL, it is changed for the 165AS as well.

**Filters **

**Filter Wizards **

Filters allow you to control what kind of data to show, for example, instead of seeing all people in your unit, perhaps you want to see only those of a selected crew position. PEX includes filters for personnel, training tasks, and commitments. To use the filter, click on the Filter Wizard icon, which looks like a funnel \(ePEX and WinPEX\) or a magic wand \(WinPEX only\), depending on the module you are in. 

**Funnel Filter Wizard **

**LAN Out Procedures **

Use this procedure if the Local Area Network \(LAN\) is down for an extended period of time that wil impact your operations. 

**CAUTION:** If you have multiple squadrons on the same database, this procedure works for each squadron to conduct PEX operations independently off LAN. However, when the LAN is back operational, only one squadron’s data can be used to update the overal database. The data the other squadrons entered into their independent instance of PEX wil not merge back in. 

**NOTES:** 

■ The process requires about two hours to accomplish and about two hours to bring your main server back up to date when the LAN is restored. 

■ The PEX Database Manager includes its own help file. Open the Database Manager and click the Help button, or refer to the PEX Database Manager User Manual on the installation disc \(documents folder\) or PEX web site. 

Go to the PEX server, use the PEX Database Manager to backup the PEX database, and copy the backup file to a CD/DVD. Use SQL Enterprise Manager to take the PEX database and its archive database offline. 

Take this CD/DVD to a computer in your squadron that will become your interim PEX server. This machine must be set up as a PEX server according to the PEX Install Guide \(i.e., operating system, SQL, Internet Explorer, IIS, MS Office, .NET, PEX DB Manager, etc.\). This setup can be done ahead of time. 

On the interim computer, use the PEX Database Manager to restore the PEX database from the backup file. Name this interim database something other than what your original database was called, e.g., primary DB name: "PEXVPS"; interim DB name: "PEXVPSTemp". 

Install ePEX \(if required\) on the interim computer machine. 

Create a smal \(off LAN\) network with the interim computer acting as the PEX server and ePEX web server. Connect a printer\(s\) to this network. 

Provide the new Connect To information to your users on the smal network so they can log into the database. 

Use PEX as normal on this interim system until the LAN is operational. 

**LAN Returns to Operation Procedures \(Single squadron, pick one\) **

441 

Miscellaneous 

On the interim computer, use the PEX Database Manager to backup the PEX database, and copy the backup file to a CD/DVD. 

Go to your main PEX server and use the PEX Database Manager to rename your previous PEX 

database to something like PEXVPS\_OLD. Then, restore the PEX database from your backup file and give it the original database name, e.g., PEXVPS. Tell your users that PEX is back up. 

The data for that squadron will be current. The data for all other squadrons will be what it was when the LAN went out. 

**Use PEX While Entire Unit Deployed **

**Concept **

When your entire unit deploys, there are options on how best to employ PEX. The best option depends upon your circumstances. Regardless of the option you employ, realize up front that there is no way to re-integrate any deployed sortie data from a different database back into your home station database upon your return. Specifically, if while deployed you use PEX in a database on a different server or with a different name from the one which continues to be in use at the home station, that deployed sortie data will never be merged with your home station database. A combination of the options below is possible too. The PEX Help Desk can assist in your decision making. 

**Options **

**Option 1. Deploy and Use Home Station PEX **

**Reasons For: **

■ You do not supply hardware or software 

■ Your deployment package does not include supporting assets 

■ No installation required at deployed location 

■ PEX processes are not subject to local procedures 

■ Home station has complete visibility 

■ Host location command and control can be granted access to your schedule, etc. 

**Reasons Against: **

■ If the deployed schedule is classified this solution will not work 

■ Requires connectivity from a potentially austere location 

■ Operations difficult to combine with other flying units using PEX at deployed location 

■ Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location **Option 2. Deploy with Your Database on Your Own Hardware **

**Reasons For: **

■ PEX is set up as desired before deployment 

■ No installation required at deployed location 

■ PEX processes are not subject to local procedures 

■ This is an approved configuration for a classified environment 

442 

**Reasons Against: **

■ You must supply additional hardware and software 

■ If the environment is classified, your supporting hardware will return classified 

■ You must account for the additional hardware in your deployment package 

■ You wil probably not be integrated into the existing network, thus you wil have no single flying operations solution 

■ Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location **Option 3. Deploy with Your Database, Instal on Host Hardware **

**Reasons For: **

■ You do not supply additional hardware or software 

■ Your deployment package does not need to include supporting assets 

■ Minimal installation required at deployed location 

■ A large amount of the preparation can be accomplished ahead of time 

■ PEX processes are not subject to local procedures 

■ Can work for either a classified or unclassified environment 

■ Determine in advance home station visibility, dependent on host network configuration 

■ Host location access is limited only by the status of their network; command and control can be granted access to your schedule, etc. 

**Reasons Against: **

■ Assumes the host is supplying all required software \(SQL Server\) 

■ You may not have a single flying operations solution 

■ Probably have to double enter a partial schedule in another system at deployed location **Option 4. Add Your Unit to Existing PEX Database **

**Reasons For: **

■ Established PEX processes at the deployed location 

■ Thoroughly integrated operations, single flying schedule solution and command visibility 

■ No dual entry 

■ No need to provide hardware or software 

■ No need to account for hardware in your deployment package 

**Reasons Against: **

■ Nothing is set up before arrival, much unit validation data will have to be tailored **Detailed Instructions **

**Option 1. Deploy and Use Home Station PEX **

443 

Miscellaneous 

Verify with your Communications Squadron the VPN solution in place. The usual solution is Microsoft Terminal Services, but there are others. Some of these other solutions may require supporting software at the deployed location. You may find your base has no solution installed. 

Verify with the deployed location that they can access your VPN solution. This should be accomplished by having them attempt to connect from a machine you wil be using during your deployment. It is possible that the network configuration at the deployed location could limit your access. These connectivity issues cannot be resolved through PEX. 

**Option 2. Deploy with Your Database on Your Own Hardware **

Configure a computer to function as a database server and another to function as a web server. This is done before you install any component of PEX. Refer to the PEX Installation Guide for minimum hardware requirements. Essentially, you need a mid-level processor and memory capability. If you are going to network the hardware on your arrival, then the full version of SQL is recommended. If the entire PEX application is to be run from the one machine, then SQL Express wil suffice. In either case the PEX Installation Guide should be read first to ensure you adhere to some specific settings required of SQL. An IIS web server is not required if you do not intend to network PEX. On a stand-alone computer, all you need is WinPEX. 

Install the PEX DB Manager, PEX Service Host, \(ePEX, if networked\), and WinPEX. Refer to the Installation Guide. After you have your home station database as current as possible with deployed information go to your server, use the PEX DB Manager and back up your database. Do this at the last minute before you deploy so that you have the most current scheduling data, Stan/Eval data, training data, etc. Take the backup file and copy it to your deploying server, then use the DB 

Manager to restore it \(see the help files for specific steps\). 

**NOTE:** If you are deploying and you were given leftover hardware/software, you may have a SQL 

compatibility issue. For example, you can restore a DB created in SQL Server 2005 into an instance of SQL Server 2008, but not the other way around. SQL Server 2005 wil not be able to restore a DB 

created in SQL Server 2008. 

Log into the new database on the deploying machine to confirm operation/functionality. Then: 

■ Delete extraneous squadrons you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous validation items that you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Add validation items you need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous aircraft tail numbers you don’t need for the deployment \(or un-check Show in Drop Down\) 

■ Add aircraft tail numbers you need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous users you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Add new users you need for the deployment and set permissions 

■ Move extraneous personnel you don’t need for the deployment to the PCS Squadron 

■ Add personnel you need for the deployment 

■ Add locations you need for the deployment \(delete or hide unneeded ones\) 

■ Change user permissions needing to be added or removed for the deployment 

■ Change the log file paths for the following: ARMS imports and exports; ATO imports; and ACO 

imports 

444 

■ Delete missions you don’t need for the deployment **Option 3. Deploy with Your Database, Instal on Host Hardware **

Verify the version of SQL Server running at the deployed location is the same or newer than the one you are using at home station. If they are running a version of SQL Server older than the one you are running, you will not be able to restore your database on their server. The only solutions would be to upgrade the deployed location SQL Server or use a different option. 

Verify the PEX version at the deployed location. PEX implements compatibility checks and will work only when all aspects of the program are the same version. I.e., the database, PEX Database Manager, ePEX, and WinPEX all have to be the same version. If the deployed location is running a different version of PEX, the only solutions would be to upgrade the deployed location PEX version or use a different option. 

After you have your home station database as current as possible with deployed information go to your server, use the PEX DB Manager and back up your database. Do this at the last minute before you deploy so that you have the most current scheduling data, Stan/Eval data, training data, etc. 

Take the backup file and copy it to your deploying server, then use the DB Manager to restore it \(see the help files for specific steps\). 

Log into the new database on the deploying machine to confirm operation/functionality. Then: 

■ Delete extraneous squadrons you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous validation items that you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Add validation items you need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous aircraft tail numbers you don’t need for the deployment \(or un-check Show in Drop Down\) 

■ Add aircraft tail numbers you need for the deployment 

■ Delete extraneous users you don’t need for the deployment 

■ Add new users you need for the deployment and set permissions 

■ Move extraneous personnel you don’t need for the deployment to the PCS Squadron 

■ Add personnel you need for the deployment 

■ Add locations you need for the deployment \(delete or hide unneeded ones\) 

■ Change user permissions needing to be added or removed for the deployment 

■ Change the log file paths for the following: ARMS imports and exports; ATO imports; and ACO 

imports 

■ Delete missions you don’t need for the deployment 

**Option 4. Add Your Unit to Existing PEX Database **

**1. ** Launch the Squadrons module and add the units/squadrons that wil be using PEX plus a 

"PCS" squadron to which you will eventually move people that have left your unit. 

**2. ** Once the squadrons are entered, personnel data can be added through the ARMS Interface or manual y through the Personnel module. 

**3. ** If your unit does not use ARMS, in the Personnel module, Setup tab, pick a unit and customize your lists. Once you are done with one squadron, you can use the right-click "Send To" command to copy the lists over to other units. 

445 

Miscellaneous 

**4. ** In the Personnel module, add your personnel manual y. 

**5. ** Launch the Aircraft module and enter your aircraft MDSs and tail numbers. 

**6. ** In the Users & Permissions module, assign other PEX users and grant them levels of access to the various PEX applications. 

**Use PEX Deployed, Integrated Squadrons **

This assumes the flying schedule is not built in unclassified PEX beforehand, but that you are entering data into PEX after flight for flying hours and training accomplishments. Our recommendation is; use home station database via ePEX for everything, except when the jet and crew come from different bases, and then use paper 781s. 

**1. ** When you arrive at the deployed location, login to your ePEX, and add the other squadron crew to your Personnel module \(just minimum information\), in your squadron. When the deployment is over, move them to the PCS squadron. In the Personnel module, on the Details tab, for the other squadron crew, check the box for "Do Not Export 781 Data" and enter their 781 Flying ORGN. 

**2. ** During deployment, as soon as possible after the sortie lands, login to the home station ePEX for the unit that owns the tail number. Using the ePEX Flying Schedule, Sorties tab, add the sortie and on the sortie, enter MDS, Tail Number, Mission Number, Mission Symbol \(MUC\), Takeoff Location, Land Location, Flight Auth Number, and associate the sortie to a flying hours account. Al this can be done in ePEX \(don't need Mission Board\). On the Crew tab, schedule the crew \(from either squadron\) and in Crew Details, enter the crew Duty Position and Pay status. 

Get this done before MX debrief. 

**3. ** **AFTO 781**. At MX Debrief, have a computer with access to both units' ePEXs. An icon for each on the desktop works well. When the crew arrives at MX Debrief, cal up the ePEX for the unit that owns the tail number. Go to the Squadron Daily Schedule \(SDS\) and the sortie will show up with a 781 link and a TAR link. The crew would click on the 781 link, fill out the electronic 781, get a MX Review and initials, and print out the 781 for MX. 

**A. ** If the crew and jet belong to the same unit, done. The flight managers can export the PEX 781 data to ARMS. \(No need for a paper 781 for ARMS\) 

**B. ** If the crew does not belong to the same unit as the jet, they wil need to bring a copy of the 781 to their flight managers for direct entry of Aircrew Data into ARMS. 

**4. ** **TAR**. If the crew belongs to the same unit as the tail number, the crew, on the SDS, clicks on the TAR link and fil s out the TAR. If the crew belongs to the other unit, the crew wil need to open up the other ePEX \(theirs\) and navigate to Training> Continuation> Reporting tab> and Person hyperlink and fill out the TAR. 

**Use PEX on NIPR and SIPR \(Deployed\) **

If your missions are classified but your other PEX data is unclassified, usually as a result of deployed operations, we recommend the following implementation: 

**1. ** Use SIPR PEX for ATO scheduling, sortie execution, and aircraft maintenance data. 

**2. ** Use NIPR PEX for Go/No-Go, FCIF, PRF, and Stan Eval. 

**3. ** When a unit deploys to your location, the home station flight management office would use their PEX Personnel module to export to file each person's PEX data. They would ensure the files make it to your location, where each person's data would be imported into both your SIPR 

446 

and NIPR PEX databases. This would provide the NIPR and SIPR databases al the current PEX 

data on each deployed person. 

**4. ** Each day, double-enter, minimum, unclassified, sortie data into the NIPR PEX so that NIPR 

AFTO 781s and continuation training data could be logged. This minimum data would be: **A. ** MDS 

**B. ** Tail Number 

**C. ** Mission Number 

**D. ** Mission Symbol 

**E. ** Takeoff Location 

**F. ** Land Location 

**G. ** Sched T/O Time \(can be bogus\) 

**H. ** Sched Land Time \(can be bogus\) 

**I. ** Assign Crew 

**5. ** When the crew gets back from flying, they would use your NIPR Squadron Daily Schedule page to enter their AFTO 781 data and to log their training events. The deployed squadron flight management would then use your NIPR PEX to audit, approve, and export to ARMS the 781 and training data. No 781s or training events would be logged on your SIPR side. 

**6. ** Once the 781 data and training events are pushed from the NIPR PEX into ARMS, the deployed flight management office would run the three Jaspersoft browsers we provide to extract data from ARMs. They would then import the three resultant .CSV files into both the NIPR and SIPR databases. This would keep both databases \(NIPR and SIPR\) current with aircrew flying time \(to track maximum flying hours\) and training currencies. Having the data in both systems is important so you have current and matching data for aircrew scheduling \(SIPR\) and Go/No-Go \(NIPR\). 

**7. ** When a unit heads back home, the deployed flight management office would use the NIPR 

PEX Personnel module to export to file each person's PEX data. They would ensure the files make it to home station, where each person's data would be imported into the NIPR PEX back home. 

**Use Your Logo Instead of US DoD **

Although the U.S. Department of Defense \(DoD\) is the primary user of PEX, you may be from another U.S. department, e.g., Dept. of Homeland Security, or from another country, e.g., Australia, Poland, or Oman. You should swap the DoD logo that appears throughout PEX with the one of your department or country. Even within DoD, you may want to swap the logo with that of your wing or group. 

**1. ** At the ePEX web server, the DoD image is stored at: 

C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\epex\\images\\DoD.gif 

**2. ** At each WinPEX client, the image is stored at: Program Files/Patriot Excalibur/ePEX/Images/DoD.gif 

**3. ** Rename the existing file to "DoD\_old.gif." 

**4. ** Save your desired image in .gif format at approximately the same size as the DoD image, about 1.5 inch square, and save your desired image as "DoD.gif" in the ePEX/Images directory.

**Users with Multiple CACs **

You may encounter users with multiple ways to logon to the network domain, usual y through one of two Common Access Cards \(CAC\). This typically happens in Reserve or Guard units when a person has a crewmember CAC and another contractor CAC. The question arises, which CAC should be associated to their PEX account? 

**Our recommendations: **

• This individual should be identified in the Personnel module only once. 

• This individual should be identified in the Users module only once. 

• The Person and User should be associated in the Users module. 

• The User should be associated to only one network account \(CAC\) in the Users module. 

That CAC should be the one they use the most. When they use the other CAC to logon the network, they would not be able to logon to PEX. 

**CAUTION:** Despite our recommendation, if you think the individual real y needs to access PEX using both network accounts \(CACs\), then: 

• This individual should be identified in the Users module twice. 

• Each User should be associated to only one network account \(CAC\) in the Users module. 

• This individual should be identified in the Personnel module only once. 

• Associate one user account \(the military one\) with the Personnel record. 

• Do not associate the other user account \(the contractor one\) with any Personnel record. 

• Via policy \(PEX can’t enforce this\), one User/Person combination should be used to manage the individual’s schedule, training, and Stan Eval. The other User account would be used for the individual to accomplish PEX administrative duties, for example.

**Security Identifier **

The PEX Security Identifier is used to sign off FCIFs, proctor tests, and pilot review AFTO 781s. The Security Identifier is defaulted to the person’s ID number \(typically, the Social Security Number\). The Security Identifier can be changed only by the user and requires six to nine characters, case-sensitive. 

**Change your Security Identifier **

**1. ** From My Page, click My Preferences. 

**2. ** In the Security Identifier fields, enter 6-9 characters and re-enter the same characters to confirm your change. Using the same number as your CAC PIN, so you don’t have to remember another password, is acceptable. 

**3. ** Click Save Preferences. 

If you forget your Security Identifier, click the “Reset to Personal ID Number” button. This resets your Security Identifier to the Personal ID Number \(usual y SSN\) saved in the Personnel module.
